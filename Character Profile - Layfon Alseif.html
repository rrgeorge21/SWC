<strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Weaving formations with the Steel Threads tend to take some time. Composite Blast tech requires some &quot;charge time&quot; to perform and he cannot change the &quot;pattern&quot; in mid-charge.<br />
<strong>Destructive Capacity:</strong> Building to multi city block level while unmotivated, <a class="wiki_link" href="Citybuster.html">city level</a> when serious, up to small continent level with Composite Blast techs | <span style="color: #800080;">Small continent level (900+ teratons or above, comparable to <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Character%20Profile%20-%20Barmelin%20Swattice%20Nolne.html">Barmelin</a>)</span><br />

<strong>Durability:</strong> Small building level+ (Layfon took a building-busting punch from <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Character%20profile%20-%20Ruimei%20Garland%20McRing.html">Ruimei</a> while he wasn't looking), can focus to increase his defenses or durability to mach his firepower<br />
<strong>Lifting Strength:</strong> Class M via <a class="wiki_link" href="Powerscaling.html">powerscaling</a><br />
<strong>Striking Strength:</strong> Varies depending on how serious he is, <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Strength%202.html">Class PJ</a>+ at maximum (matched Savaris who similarly lacked his Heavens Blade) | <span style="color: #800080;">Above Class PJ+, Class ZJ while infusing his attacks with External Kei</span><br />
<strong>Stamina:</strong> Massive (can fight non-stop for 3 days without food, water, or any chance to rest)<br />
<strong>Standard Equipment</span>:</strong> Sapphire Dite (with two settings: Steel Threads and katana form), Adamantine Dite (large curved sword, much stronger than his Sapphire Dite, it also has Steel Threads function), Shin Adamantium Dite (his &quot;strongest&quot; weapon, an even larger curved blade) | <span style="color: #800080;">Heavens Blade (curved blade called &quot;Wolfstein&quot;; allows Layfon to wield his full power, needs <a class="wiki_link" href="OP.html">OP</a> to specify whether he has it)</span><br />
<strong>Intelligence:</strong> Combat genius, became a Heavens Blade Successor as early as at the age of 10, can analyze and break down an opponent's skill then copy it after seeing that only once. His talent at controlling his Kei was described as &quot;monstrous&quot; instead of just being a genius. Has detailed knowledge of human anatomy and the Kei circulatory system. Layfon also possesses top-notch swordsmanship and battle instincts.<br />
<strong>Notable Attacks/Techniques:</strong><br />
<br />
<em>- Sougenkyou (&quot;Steel Threads&quot;):</em> Layfon can use at least many thousands of micro-filaments called as &quot;steel threads&quot;. These are incredibly thin, so much that normally only the enhanced vision of the Heavens Blade Successors can see them. Albeit these threads can grow thicker and when filled with Kei they radiate visible light which could be a giveaway. But with sufficient planning this can be timed such that the enemy likely won't have enough time to react. Each thread can move like an extension of Layfon's body and he can even feel with them like they were his nerves. With steel threads Layfon can search his surroundings and attack the enemy from countless directions at once or engage multiple opponents. He can even use the threads like a rope to swing between buildings akin to <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Character%20Profile%20-%20Spider-Man.html">Spiderman</a>. Layfon can also weave complex formations for more advanced techniques. It can be a powerful concentrated attack, a defensive net layered with walls of Kei or even something like a trap to catch the enemy by surprise. Unlike his teacher <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Character%20Profile%20-%20Lintence%20Haden.html">Lintence</a> though Layfon cannot weave these complex formations instantly so in general it requires some kind of prep.<br />
<br />
- <em>Composite Kei Techniques</em>: In volume 18 Layfon realizes a new method to overcome the limitations of his Dite. Normal Dites can only store and channel a limited amount of power. But Layfon combines this with the delayed Kei technique common for Karenkei users. As a result Layfon keeps releasing his Kei in &quot;small&quot; stacks, just enough to not overload the weapon. These stacks add up for a single delayed Kei technique which then Layfon executes thus effectively unleashing attacks at any power he wants. There are two downsides though. First, since Layfon unleashes his Kei in waves instead of in one go it obviously requires some time (albeit it gradually grows shorter as Layfon gets accustomed to the technique). Second, since it's a delayed Kei technique Layfon must decide what kind of attack to use before he begins charging it up, not allowing him to change it if the situation calls for it. In addition rapidly and repeatedly charging a Dite to its limit is obviously harmful. They usually can only withstand 3-4 Composite Blast techniques before getting broken in the process (this might change too as Layfon masters the technique).<br />
<br />
- <em>Sakkei</em>: A technique where the Military Artist blocks the emission of their Kei thus keeping them hidden from the eyes of other Military Artists. The user must control his/her Kei and tone down the output to prevent detection. External Kei Burst type techniques are out of question but skilled practioners can use Internal Kei techniques without increasing their emission by much. Experts can seemingly also make themselves literally invisible, disappearing from plain view. Still, Sakkei is only practical for stealth and ambush attacks, fighting while using Sakkei is so far unprecedented in the series.<br />
<br />
<em>- External Burst - Sendan</em>: Layfon gathers his Kei into a single point and then swings down his sword, releasing a crescent-shaped energy blade with great power. The thickness of this &quot;blade&quot; can be adjusted, making it either effect a wide area or become focused to a paper-thin plane for the greatest cutting power.<br />
<br />
<em>- External Burst - Bakushikou:</em> Layfon stabs the opponent with his sword and releases a large explosion within. In Filth Monsters this tech leaves a gaping huge hole. In humans... I leave that to your imagination.<br />
<br />
<em>- External Burst - Roar Kei:</em> Layfon releases a tremendous amount of Kei into his voice.The attack can disrupt matter on the molecular level and can be used to counter opposing Kei blasts or even explosions. On low settings Roar Kei causes severe internal bleeding and disorients human foes. To note though Layfon has yet to fully master this technique.<br />
<br />
<em>- Combined Internal and External Burst - The Thousand Killers:</em> Layfon quickly generates up to thousands of copies of himself. They can use any attack or technique Layfon could but, like Naruto's shadow clones, they dissipate after only receiving one hit.<br />
<br />
<em>- Internal Kei - Fleeting Shadow</em>:<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Special technique used to boost speed and confuse the enemy. Layfon casts an illusion which leaves an afterimage of him while Layfon is already moving to a different direction. By the time the enemy realizes this Layfon usually had already managed to do what he wanted.</span><br />
<br />
<em>- Psyharden Technique - Water Mirror</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">: Layfon's fastest technique which increases his speed massively for an instant, allowing him to almost <a class="wiki_link" href="Speedblitz.html">blitz</a> <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Character%20Profile%20-%20Savaris%20Luckens.html">Savaris</a> and <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Character%20Profile%20-%20Felli%20Loss.html">Felli</a> was unable to follow his movements through her psychokinetic Flakes (unlike before).</span><br />
<br />
<em>- Psyharden Technique - Houshintotsu</em>: Layfon sends countless tiny Kei needles inside the opponent's body and blocks their Kei circulation, essentially crippling them.<br />
<br />
- <em>Psyharden Technique - Rot:</em> Layfon sends his Kei inside the opponent's weapon and destroys it in a single blow.<br />
<br />
<em>- Heaven's Blade Technique - Kasumirou:</em> Layfon stabs his sword inside the target and releases countless Kei spikes inside, slicing up its insides in an instant. This technique destroyed every internal organ of a huge Filth Monster; it's power should be much more effective against human-sized foes.<br />
<br />
- <em>External Burst - Rumbling Sword:</em> Layfon channels his fury and Kei into his sword which turns red as he throws that at his target. On impact the sword violently explodes, destroying the Dite and also preferably his target. When he wields a Heavens Blade this technique is far more powerful and he used it to vaporize a fine portion of <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Character%20Profile%20-%20Nano-Celluloid%20Interface%20M%20Durandal.html">Durandal</a>'s dome and shook entire <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Faction%20Profile%20-%20Grendan.html">Grendan</a>. Also as expected the Heavens Blade was tough enough to withstand this power and it had eventually flown back to Layfon on its own.<br />
<br />
<br />
He's also supposed to know almost every technique from <a class="wiki_link_new" href="Faction%20Profile%20-%20Grendan.html">Grendan</a>, including the signature attacks of most Heavens Blade Successors. Hell, by now he knows nearly every Military Arts technique shown in the series.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Hadrian has a strong sense of justice and morality, claiming that there
 is no rationale behind his desire to aid and protect others beyond the 
fact that it would leave him with lingering regrets if he simply 
abandoned them, a feeling that he describes as "a bad aftertaste".
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>He was enrolled as an archaeology student at the Miskatonic 
University but used this as a cover for his true major in sorcery under 
the tutelage of Dr. Henry Armitage. During an attempt to break into the 
library to read one of the forbidden grimoires, he was attacked by 
Wilbur Whateley and almost killed, causing him to distance himself from 
the occult and drop out of the university entirely. He continued to work
 as a private investigator but was financially poor until the day he was
 hired by the Hadou Financial Group to acquire a grimoire. In his 
search, he encounters Al-Azif and circumstances force him into a 
contract with her, becoming the pilot of the imitation Deus Machina, 
Demonbane (デモンベインDemonbein?). After encountering the inhumanity of 
Master Therion, he comes to hate the man with a passion, fuelling his 
determination to destroy the Black Lodge.<br>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_Abilities">Special Abilities</span></h2>
<p><b>Blessings of the Light</b>: Hadrian can tap into paracasual force that ties together the Universe and all life within it. It's power dwells within his soul allowing him to tap into the universal forces in the form of Light and can be empowered greatly by combining with the dimensional energies refered to as Mana.<br>
<ul><li><b>Striker</b>: Having been taught to use Arc Light, Hadrian can draw upon the Electromagnetic Field of an entire Solar System for various electromagnetic abilities such as blasts and beams of electricity. He can nullify magnetic properties and use his connection to the EM Field to mentally influence and control mechanical devices and even augment their power. Due to his high level of skill with Arc Light, he can even increase his speed to the point of "Blink" teleportation as well as gaining the ability to see into the EM Spectrum (mostly Ultraviolet Vision). It also disrupts any mentally affecting powers such as mind control and mind reading and can even cause weather changes.</li>
<li><b>Sunbreaker</b>: Having been trained to draw upon Solar Light, Hadrian can manipulate quantum energy for both healing and empowering purposes as well as explosive blasts. He can manifest and shape the light very much like a flame increasing its heat to star levels of temperature. He can also expel the light into the form of flaming jets for flight and create a solar light hammer that can send out seeking blasts of energy. The Solar Light can also be used on touch as an energy strike or to heal others of wounds, or even to form types of solar explosive "grenades".</li>
<li><b>Sentinel</b>: Hadrian can mentally draw upon Void Light to wield dark energy to create and manipulate mass effect fields as biotic skills. Most biotic abilities fall into three categories. The simplest are instinctive abilities, such as barriers, biotic martial arts, and direct kinetic effects like telekinesis. These rely on a direct manipulation of mass effect energies. More complicated are invoked effects, which require some level of control over the field, such as warp fields, biotic explosions, and other indirect applications. These use the body's nervous system to shape the field, almost like a pulsar field. The most complex biotics are evoked effects, which use the fields to directly manipulate energy or gravity as a force instead of upon an object. The most spectacular effects of biotics, such as singularity or blaze, fall into this category.</li></ul>
</p>
<p><b>Pact With <a href="http://gubaba.org/mi2/wiki/index.php/Etheldreda" title="Etheldreda">Etheldreda</a></b>:
 Hadrian is bound to the Pnakotic Manuscripts until his death. This has given him 
several unique powers, listed below. Even though the pact is life-long and 
intimately linked to Harry, these are all powers that any master of the Pnakotic Manuscripts can use.<br>
<ul><li><b>Hyperborea Zero Drive</b>: His strongest spell that creates an energy sphere in the palm of your hand that freezes objects along with everything that has fallen into the affected area (including reality itself and all its aspects), to infinitely low temperatures. It can even be imbued into his weapons, like his blade, to freeze anything in its path or strikes.</li>
<li><b>Cross of Sinner</b>: A reversed Catholic Cross shaped sword capable of changing shapes and sizes. It's a weapon specialized for cutting and was able to slash a large mountain sized monster in half. Swinging the blade can create shockwaves. It can also from seven smaller light energy crosses that can be used as projectiles.</li>
<li><b>Darkness of N'kai</b>: A spell that releases a number of areas of concentrated gravity, like micro-black holes, capable of absorbing even sunlight and is often used as long range concentrated bullets of gravity.</li>
<li><b>Abrahadabra</b>: A spell that fires off blasts of energy in the form of lightning from the hands.</li>
<li><b>Bow of Sirius</b>: Transforms the Cross of Sinner into the shape of a bow that shoots light arrows, with "Multi-shots" of up to 10 at once, effectively penetrating armor and barriers. Can also use a "Shower of Light" that launches an specially formed arrow upwards, which soon explodes into countless stakes and shards of light bombarding the enemy.</li>
<li><b>Hexagonal Barrier</b>: Spell that creates a barrier can fend off mental, physical and spiritual attacks while also likely working against space-time warping abilities and black holes. Barrier radiance can also dispel weaker enemy magic.</li></ul>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers_.26_Merits">Powers &amp; Merits</span></h2>
<b>Combat Skills</b>: Hadrian is an expert combatant, wielding a wide variety of different weapons with expert precision, shifting between them on a whim when the situation calls for it. In addition, he holds perfect synergy to adapt to different battlefields and can command others even in intense combat. He is also a skilled diplomat and hand to hand fighter with multiple martial skills. Hadrian is also proficient in stealth, being able to sneak around heavily-guarded bases, and warp-kill targets while remaining undetected.<br>
<p><b>Innate Magics</b>: These are the innate Magics that Hadrian can use at a passive state without drawing in any major power:<br>
<ul><li>The Light provides a form of rune arts and magicks that allow him to manipulate the environment. He has grown with his skill to utilize the Light outside its specific active abilities and channel its actual elemental properties. He can use electromagnetism (Arc Light), fire shaping and healing (Solar Light), and dark energy based telekinesis and Biotics (Void Light).</li>
<li>Supernatural Senses (is capable of expanding his mind and senses across the whole universe, can also accelerate his thought process to the point where time freezes and see invisible things), Information Analysis (can analyze his opponents abilities on the informational level and view their weak points), Instincts which are often close to precognition in battle</li>
<li>Amplification of all senses, enhanced physical abilities through a superior form of Reinforcement, and a type of clairvoyance</li></ul>
<b>Intelligence</b>:  Extraordinary Genius (A skilled leader and master tactician to an almost unparalleled degree within the Last City). A combat genius, confident in his own incredible skills yet still humble and knowing of what he can improve. He also possesses top-notch marksmanship, CQC, and battle instincts.<br>
<b>Enhancements</b>: Aesir are a cybernetically enhanced variant of the Spartan I Super Soldier Program. While not quite as strong as an armored Spartan II, he is still capable of extreme feats of physical prowess combined the versitality of the force. Hadrian learnt to tap into the memories of his past life as Guardian Captain Wolf, Baldur the Aesir, and the Darth Imperius to call upon certain of their old skills and abilities as his own such as their various Light, Cybernetic, and Force prowesses.<br>
<ul><li><b>Aesir Enhancements</b>: As an elite Aesir warrior, he has incredible strength, speed, agility, endurance, durability, stamina, and reaction times due to minor cybernetic enhancements, experience, and training. His blood type was synthetic XNA with its immunity boosted with a regenerative ability of 98%. He has a highly refined sharpshooting prowess and is a master swordsman with a notable adaptation trait that allows him to combat opponents with a variety of weapons.</li>
<li><b>Force</b>: Applied abilities include telepathy, empathy, mental influence, psychometry, accelerated healing, advanced precognition, defensive barriers, and superhuman self-enhancement. He can augment his natural athleticism, allowing for speed, coordination and acrobatic maneuvers beyond natural limits. As well the vitality, health, stamina, and endurance of a Force user was naturally enhanced to varying degrees and could be boosted further. He also gains a sixth sense to monitor the battlefield as well as a danger sense paired with enhanced reflexes.</li>
<li><b>Void Light</b>: Hadrian primarily controls his emission of dark energy in certain forms. The basic are instinctive abilities, such as barriers, biotic martial arts, and direct kinetic effects like telekinesis. More advanced uses include directly manipulating energy or gravity as a force. He can even use void light to either teleport across battlefields or manifest spectral bows and daggers.</li>
<li><b>Arc Light</b>: Hadrian can draw upon the Electromagnetic Field of an entire Solar System for various electromagnetic abilities such as blasts and beams of electricity. He can nullify magnetic properties and use his connection to the EM Field to mentally influence and control mechanical devices and even augment their power. He can also manifest manifest an electric fighting staff.</li>
<li><b>Solar Light</b>: Hadrian can manipulate quantum energy for both empowering purposes as well as explosive blasts. He can manifest and shape the light very much like a flame increasing its heat to star levels of temperature. He can also expel the light into the form of gun that can send out seeking blasts of energy or a set of target seeking throwing blades.</li>
<li><b>Infusion</b>: His variation of the Item Construction skill, rather than creating their own magic items wholesale, Hadrian infuses his own magic into ordinary items to grant them different effects. Ordinary drinks become healing potions, armor gains resistances and weapons gain minor abilities. Due to the Light, Hadrian can draw from multiple sources to imbue a range of different effects.</li>
<li><b>Elemancy</b>: A rare type of ancient Magecraft. Any spells, even those of the level of High-Thaumaturgy, can be cast at the speed of Single-Action spells. This magic is especially unique in that it can be drawn from either the energy of nature or the energy of the Light. He can also use the Thaumaturgical form to sublimate the elements into prepared spells. An ability to create a form of Mystic Code which allows for the rapid deployment of magic without an incantation. Because the magic has to be prepared beforehand, it is difficult to adjust on the fly. At a high level, effects that would decimate even a village, like containing a blizzard in a bottle or a deadly firestorm that would rival the wrath of a divinity is possible.
<ul><li><b>Assassin Rush</b>: Propels the caster through space in an instant, allowing the Hero to phase through attacks and teleport to a target's vulnerable backside to counterattack.</li>
<li><b>Slow Time</b>: Affects the very fabric of time itself, slowing everything around the Hero to a crawl while leaving the caster immune.</li>
<li><b>Force Push</b>: Generates a powerful shock-wave which radiates out from the caster, sending nearby enemies sprawling. Useful when greatly outnumbered.</li>
<li><b>Physical Shield</b>: Surrounds the caster with a protective sphere of energy that will absorb all damage at the expense of Will, until the caster has no Will remaining. The shield will be removed if the spell is cast again.</li>
<li><b>Multi Arrow</b>: Once this spell is cast, each arrow fired is magically transformed into a multitude of lethal projectiles, causing much greater damage. Higher levels of mastery generate even more arrows. One can keep track of the number of shots the Hero has left using Multi-Arrow by counting the number of light motes swirling around them. Each mote represents a shot using Multi-Arrow.</li>
<li><b>Heal Life</b>: Allows the caster to trade in his magical energy for regenerating from wounds at an accelerated pace. This regeneration can also be passed on to non-hostile entities in the vicinity.</li>
<li><b>Ghost Sword</b>: Summons ethereal blades from the netherworld to do battle on behalf of the caster.</li>
<li><b>Divine Fury</b>: This devastating spell channels the white-hot fury of the gods into concentrated beams that hit all foes within a certain radius.</li>
<li><b>Battle Charge</b>: Propels the caster forward at a great speed enough speed to set the ground ablaze, smashing into anything in their path and blasting all nearby aside.</li>
<li><b>Multi Strike</b>: Imbues the user's blade with the ability to strike multiple times with a single blow. The higher the user's level of mastery, the more blows they can stack.</li>
<li><b>Fire/Fira/Firaga</b>: Hadrian generates fire energy in his hand, before unleashing the magic energy and causing a small explosion at a location of his choosing, burning both the enemy and the surrounding area.</li>
<li><b>Blizzard/Blizzara/Blizzaga</b>: Hadrian causes the surrounding area to become blanketed in frost and ice, freezing enemies in the vicinity and the landscape.</li>
<li><b>Thunder/Thundara/Thundaga</b>: Hadrian summons a bolt of lightning to strike his enemy from above.</li>
<li><b>Death</b>: Channeling the power of the Ring of the Lucii, Hadrian begins draining his enemy of their life force, regaining his own vitality and eventually killing the foe.</li>
<li><b>Holy</b>: Whenever he phases through an attack, Hadrian leaves behind an explosion of holy energy that burns enemies to ashes with white fire. If Hadrian manages to blink through an attack at the last possible second, he will generate an even more powerful burst of Holy that quickly heals his wounds and restores his magical energy.</li>
<li><b>Alterna</b>: By concentrating his magical energy, Hadrian shatters the fabric of the universe and sucks in all nearby enemies into the void.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Eye of the Mind (False)</b>: The power to sense and avoid danger through a 6th sense that can be augmented by experience. Thanks to an item worn by Hadrian, he is capable of reacting to any attack, even without knowledge of it or the attacker.</li>
<li><b>Phasing</b>: The power to briefly become intangible and travel across large distances. An evasive skill reliant on the user's ability to perceive danger, when combined with Eye of the Mind, it is nearly impossible to hit him in melee.</li>
<li><b>Armiger-The Power of Kings</b>: This manifests in the ability to forge weapons in midair and connect their magic to them, making it an dimensional anchor in the current dimension. Hadrian can then shift out of the current dimension and come back using the anchor as a reference point, allowing them to warp to the weapon's side in an instant.This allows him to quickly traverse the battlefield by throwing or shooting their weapons and warping to it, allowing for a highly mobile form of combat. He has also learnt to use this power to store his various weapons and use his energy to replicate or synthesize any ammunition or copies as needed.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Unique_Items">Unique Items</span></h2>
<p><b>Benihime</b>: Hadrian's preferred one-handed weapon that was forged by him, absorbing the elemental powers of those it defeats. Hadrian later upgrades it with the latest in Insomnian technology to create its Ultima form, an immensely more powerful weapon that also increases Hadrian's health and mana reserves.<br>
<b>Ring of the Lucci</b>:  A treasured item passed down by all of the kings of Lucis to their successors, it binds their souls together and allows them to draw on the power of true Light. Upon activation, it grants Hadrian incredible magical power and access to the whole of the Armiger Arsenal, but this can be incredibly exhausting after use, so it is not something he can use lightly until after much experience.<br>
<b>Royal Arms</b>: The thirteen ancestral weapons passed down by the greatest kings of the Lucii, Noctis gains access to them while utilizing the powers of the Armiger Arsenal.<br>
<b><a href="http://gubaba.org/mi2/wiki/index.php/Etheldreda" title="Etheldreda">Pnakotic Manuscripts</a></b>: His Grimiore which takes the form of the girl <a href="http://gubaba.org/mi2/wiki/index.php/Etheldreda" title="Etheldreda">Etheldreda</a>, assists Hadrian to transform into his Magius State and summon various equipment as needed. This is exmplified in her merging into an empty Ghost Shell and supporting his Light Warlock abilities.<br>
<b>Custom Amun-Ra Stealth Ship</b>: A custom Stealth ship/Frigate armed with the latest technology and advanced weaponry, shields, a holographic cloaking device, and even an experimental jump drive.<br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Items_Of_Note">Items Of Note</span></h2>
<p><b>Combat Unifom</b>: clothing of Guardians, generating electromagnetic waves and fields to repel attacks aimed at the user. They have limited energy per wave, which is why bullets and small destructive waves are blocked without problems, but no more powerful explosions. However a Guardian's Light can easily recharge these fields given a few short seconds.</li>
<ul><li><i>Heavy armor</i>: is an extra layer of protection from various metal enchanted armor, laser and spatial barrier shields and garments that provide high protection against physical, elemental and spatial attacks.</li></ul>
<b>Light Enhanced Weaponry</b>: Has Access to an inventory holding a variety of weapons of all types. He personally prefers the use of his dual pistols, assault rifle, and sword. He can also easily use his magic to synthesize more ammunition as his armaments need.<br>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weaknesses_.26_Flaws">Weaknesses &amp; Flaws</span></h2>
<p><b>Item-Dependent</b>: Without the Necronomicon, Kurou cannot summon 
the Mirror of Nitocris, the Scimitar of Barzai, or use his Magius state more effectively, 
leaving him with only his basic magical knowledge, Light Skills, and Cthugha and 
Ithaqua. Obviously, without his handguns, he does not have guns. <br>
<b>Human</b>: Kurou is exceptionally resilient, and he can heal himself in Magius state. However, if attacked without the protection of <a href="http://gubaba.org/mi2/wiki/index.php/Al-Azif" title="Al-Azif">Al-Azif</a>,
 he is as vulnerable as any human being, which is only considered a 
weakness because most of the things and people he fights are capable of 
destroying cities, are alien abominations, or are super powerful robots.<br>

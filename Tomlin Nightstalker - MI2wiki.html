<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SPECIAL_ABILITIES.2C_POWERS">SPECIAL ABILITIES, POWERS</span></h2>
<p><b>True Magician</b>: Hadrian can draw upon the power of the Sixth Magic "Astral Manisfestation" to wield numerous psionic type or psychic based powers:<br>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Power of Cosmos</b>: Allows the user to draw upon the vast resources of the Cosmos and reinforce or more easily learn any skill connected to various pyschic disciplines. His vast psionic ability has also merged into his Aura and Force Sensitvity integrating them together as well as supporting his unique biotic ability (based more on psionic/telekinetic manipulation rather than controling eezo nodes reactions).</li>
<li><b>Amplification/Reinforcement</b>: He can freely use Aura/Force's more personal applications, such as the ability to strengthen the body to its maximum limit and Reinforcing even mundane weapons to the point they could match mythical weapons. This can also be used to increase both the power as well as the effects of others' semblances and Force powers.</li>
<li><b>Brilliant Mind</b>: Gifted to Genius Level, has continuously won fights in which he is outclassed using cunning strategy and an insanely adaptive thinking set. Has repeatedly outsmarted beings which can live thousands of years. To many he would be considered a consummate general and was arguably one of the most imaginative strategists and tactician amongst his peers.</li></ul>
<p><b>Special Operative</b>: With a combination of natural skill and extreme training, Hadrian has picked up a mastery in numerous combat disciplines and various support skills. Hadrian is a combat genius being a master swordsman and precise marksman, personally perfering a mix various combat styles combined with his enhanced speed and acrobatics.<br>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities">Abilities</span></h3>
<p><b>Immense Energy Reserves</b>: The manifestation of one's soul, a form of Magic native to the world of Renmant, an Aura allows one to surpass their limits, and skilled users can tap upon the Power of Mana inherent within an Aura to achieve a variety of Miracles. The most common of such miracles are Semblances, which are unique powers that come deeply from within one's soul. The types and powers of Semblances vary greatly, with the weakest equaling simple magecraft and the greatest surpassing True Magic. It is connected to the Force is the very spark of life and creation.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Hyper Intuition</b>: He possess a sixth sense of the world around him that combines with his precognitive abilities for an unusually precise and astute analysis of situations, environments, and people. It also operates very much like granting him Sherlock Holmes levels of attention to details and intuition.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Condition</b>: Due to an accidental encounter with a proto-prothean artifact, his body and mind has been enhanced into the low superhuman level even before the Force, and can more easily use gravitational fields with his aura to increase his own physical capabilities further more quickly and instinctively. He also gained variations of certain Prothean abilities such as their enhanced senses and a unique ability to draw upon ambient energy in the surrounding air or even on the magnetic field of the planet for additional power.</li>
<li><b>Force Awareness</b>: He is able to sense danger warning him of nearby and immediate threats, sense the mental state of nearby creatures, and the natural energies that flow through a planet allowing him to sense seismic, natural, and weather patterns around him. He can enhance his senses as well, using it to track or id encountered scents, to detect certain chemical combinations, to hear greater distances or frequencies he might otherwise be unable to detect, and allowing him to see further and with more clarity to shifting his vision to detect infrared or radio waves. Through the Force which provides him with precognitive abilties, and his specialization in using it to enhance his physical speed and reflexes, Hadrian has amazing situational awareness. His danger-sense is fine tuned, and his instincts well-honed for the rigors of combat that paired with enhanced reflexes allows him to react incredibly fast and precise.</li></ul>
<p><b>Augmentations</b>: Hadrian has recieved various cybernetic augementations and gene enhancements that boosts his physical and mental faculties further than a human can process or build. He also has the unique ability to use Telekinetis to manipulate dark energy for biotics at a more powerful and precise level:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Force Sensitivity</b>: Usage of the Force granted a number of useful powers, such as the ability to sense impending attacks; to push, lift, and otherwise manipulate physical objects; to influence the minds of others; to sedate or induce sleep; and even see the future. A powerful Force-sensitive could conjure lightning from their hands and fingers. Force users were able to, both consciously and inherently through their connection to the Force, augment their own natural athleticism, allowing for speed, coordination and acrobatic maneuvers beyond natural limits. The vitality, health, stamina, and endurance of a Force user was naturally enhanced to varying degrees and could even be temporarily boosted much further by those more powerful and skilled.</li>
<li><b>Rush</b>: Adrenaline Rush stimulator conduits increase the users speed for short periods of time, adapted from Sirta Foundation technology for military use. It allows him to more easily increase his body's movement, running faster, allowing for rapid strikes, allowing him to perceive the things around him in slow motion, and react with incredible reflexes. This in turn makes dodging easier, and allows him to attack much quicker and more accurately than normal.</li>
<li><b>Biotics</b>: While naturally powerful, his abilities have been further enhanced beyond normal limits due to genetic modifications resulting from an encounter with a proto-"Prothean" artifact. At a very basic, he has cooldown times a quarter that of conventional biotics, and power levels augmented by ambient heat, magnetism or existing dark energy and can bring forth enough power to tear down skyscrapers. He is able to feel the fields of mass and gravity vector, permeating the surrounding space. It already operates not with separate vectors and parts of space, but with whole planes and "gravitational currents" in them. Telekinesis is as natural for him as the movement of limbs - it does not require concentration, everything happens at the level of reflexes. A biotic of such a rank is able to effectively resist the directed gravitational and biotic effects and to “crack” other people's biotic barriers, as well as repel heavy fire at numerous opponents. With the addition of Force Telekinesis, he can also operate Biotics at a more micro level with precision.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specializations">Specializations</span></h3>
<p><b>Powers/Applications</b>: Hadrian can subconsciously tap into the virtually unlimited energy resources of the Force in order to manipulate matter and energy up to a potentially unlimited scale. This mostly operates in the form of his ability to use the Force to manipulate dark energy and disphay various sensory skills and physical enhancements.<br>
<ul><li><b>Tactical Cloak</b>: The Glass-Shield Cloaking system allows the user to turn invisible using light-refracting mass effect fields, hiding you from visual and technological detection - a tactical advantage in infiltration and wetwork.  It achieves this by generating a carefully tuned, spherical, electromagnetic mass effect field that can control the refraction of light in the user's immediate vicinity. In essence, this field steers light around the user and returns it to its original path with a perturbation rate of less than 3%.</li>
<li><b>Force Enhance:</b> It allowed a user to enhance their physical and sometimes mental condition, allowing them to be stronger, faster, more resistant than someone normal of their species or type, through the Force. With the power a user could lift and throw 800 lbs to 10 tons, run 30 to 80 mph (Without Force Speed), jump 10 to 100 feet (Without Force Jump), react lightning fast, withstand blows, hard impacts, falls from high heights, heal from injuries faster and smell better, see farther and hear better. While most could only hold this state with a certain amount of focus for a few minutes to an hour, masters are capable of holding it for days to months at even a subconscious level.</li>
<li><b>Anya-Seff:</b> Harry is able to manipulate his body's electromagnetic field to fool electroencephalo-scans, make his brain activity undetectable, and simply cause alterations to his own Electromagnetic field to survive in irradiated conditions. Harry is also able to use this ability to alter his Electromagnetic field to repel other energy fields around his body allowing him to pass through them unharmed. This can be formed as a shield that is composed of a magnetic-repulsive field, that increases the amount of damage that he can take before succumbing to an injury.</li>
<li><b>Dark Energy Manipulation</b>: Hadrian can mentally use the Force to manipulate dark energy to create and manipulate mass effect fields as biotic skills. Most biotic abilities fall into three categories. The simplest are instinctive abilities, such as barriers, biotic martial arts, and direct kinetic effects like telekinesis. These rely on a direct manipulation of mass effect energies. More complicated are invoked effects, which require some level of control over the field, such as warp fields, biotic explosions, and other indirect applications. These use the body's nervous system to shape the field, almost like a pulsar field. The most complex biotics are evoked effects, which use the fields to directly manipulate energy or gravity as a force instead of upon an object. The most spectacular effects of biotics, such as singularity or blaze, fall into this category.</li>
<li><b>Battle Precognition</b>: Hadrian has glimmers from the Force that allow him to foretell the movements of his opponents with a degree of accuracy that is often mistaken for natural instincts and quickened reflexes. He uses this ability to predict the path of projectiles, the danger of making one action versus another in flight, or as a highly accurate form of Danger Sense that not only informs him of imminent danger but also can assist him in taking steps to avoid that unseen and unknown danger. The ability of foresight was perhaps universal to Force- sensitives and was manifested in the form of Force visions of future events, guiding premonitions or warnings, and an inflow of prescience that helped them predict their opponent's movements.</li>
<li><b>Astral Wind/Force Healing</b>: Unleashes a restorative wave of Force energy, healing himself and his allies as well as recharging affected units' shields. It accelerates the body's natural healing process at a rapid pace. Master practitioners of the art can even heal themselves from fatal injuries in a short span of time (like being cooked alive, punctured lungs, etc). Although not as skilled with this ability as Master healers, Harry has shown enough competency to greatly accelerate the healing of light to moderate wounds and ease the pain of those just about to pass away.</li>
<li><b>Alter Environment/Lightning</b>: An ability which allows the user to manipulate the weather around them. Hadrian has used this ability to conjure a thick fog to cover an escape, blast away enemies with powerful whirlwinds, freeze the surfaces of small lakes and rivers, and manipulate natural lightning from storms to strike at targets of his choosing. He has a natural ability to draw from his own force potential, or alter the surrounding area's electromagnetic signatures to become lightning for him to use. He can draw upon the electromagnetic forces with ease.</li>
<li><b>Force Telekinesis</b>: A general term for the altering of objects through the force via pulling, or pushing. These can range from a Repulse to throw large amounts of enemies off of himself, Barriers to defend himself, or simply to push an opponent away from him. While this is a great group of abilities to learn from, it is from these sub categories that Harry finds he is more suitable with. Various abilities that can be labeled under this genre of the force can be anything from, Push, Pull, Rend, Burst, Whirlwind, Wave, Repulse, Inertia, Jump, Speed, Shockwave, and even Injure.</li>
<li><b>Technometry</b>: The ability to reach out and read or interact electrical systems with the force. While this is limited to mostly interpreting them and allowing him to unlock electrical locks or even open electrical doors with ease, it also allows for greater understanding of technology systems through the force, as well as how they work, function, or otherwise operate. It can also reveal weaknesses within coding, armors, or otherwise items.</li>
<li><b>Force:</b> Force is the common term for using potential kinetic energy to weigh down the hands or feet for close quarters battle. A variation on this not only enhances the impact power of their punches and kicks, but uses carefully timed pulses of gravitic force to accelerate the his body and movements to faster than the eye can follow. This allows devastating hits with fluidity and evasion.</li>
<li><b>Slide:</b> This modified form of lift creates gravity-lite tunnels and channels through which a user can move or slide with extreme speed and ease. Combined with aid (use of biotics to boost a jump or leap), it allows stupendous feats of acrobatics and evasion. Clever uses of these fields can also slow opponents even as the biotic moves too fast to counter.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h3>
<p><b>Runes of Battle</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Quicken</b>: The psyker twists time, their outline blurring as they and their fellows move like phantoms across the field. </li>
<li><b>Enhance</b>: The psyker enhances the combat skills of his allies</li>
<li><b>Conceal/Reveal</b>: The psyker takes command of the darkness around them, using it to conceal their kin or reveal any opponents who skulk in the shadows.</li></ul>
<p><b>Runes of Fate</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Guide</b>: The psyker twists the strands of destiny to their will, picking out targets from amidst the swirling chaos of battle and guiding the shots of his allies to where they might do the most harm.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="NOTABLE_ITEMS">NOTABLE ITEMS</span></h2>
<p><b>Spectre Master Gear HSBC-04 RAA "Dark Hero" Rapid Assault/Combat Armor</b>: A uniquely built battle armor based upon mixing ancient Inusannon/Prothean technology with modern equipment, generating electromagnetic waves and fields to repel attacks aimed at the user. They have limited energy per wave, which is why bullets and small destructive waves are blocked without problems, but not more powerful explosions. However the user's Aura/Force power can easily recharge these fields given a few short seconds. These were also be upgraded to include a uniquely enhanced heavy armor that acts as an extra layer of protection including various metal enchanted armor, laser and kinetic barrier shields and garments that provide high protection against physical, plasma, and energy attacks. It also offers a variety of new support such as: 
<ul><li>2,7 times more Armor Resistance and heat dissipation.</li>
<li>200% more mobility, with new nano system that helps improve abilities, graviton system in the boots and a little jump thruster.</li>
<li>Micro-computers, sensors, nano technology, neural system and Virtual Intelligence assistant.</li>
<li>Anti-Indoctrination System and anti-hack.</li>
<li>Ultra Low Weight, thanks to new materials.</li>
<li>Resistance to all weather, radiation, EMP, toxic environment, high and low temperatures. Continuous oxygen capability with new artificial photosynthesis recycler system and filters.</li>
<li>Medigel auto-system and nano auto-repair</li>
<li>Quantum, FTL and normal Communication systems</li>
<li>Cloaking system (but lost the shield and some function meanwhile use this option)</li>
<li>Mini energy reactor with regeneration system (produce or recover energy with movement of the soldier and corporal temperature). Provide the energy for the armor.</li>
<li>Helmet integrates a great quantity of powerful micro-computers and sensors, that help to soldiers in detections, vision, scanner, health, communication, protection, etc. that show the data in the screen.</li></ul>
<p><b>"Xth Saber" Nemesis Force Saber</b>: The Force Sword exemplifies an amalgamation of sorcery and science. A lighter version, of the force halberd, a force sword can take many forms. Force swords are crafted using arcane magicks and complex scientific formulae and incorporates a powerfield like all Nemesis Force Weapons. The handle is tempered iron, flecked with shards of silver and inset with ancient runes of daemon-slaying. In contrast to these primitive materials, the haft and hilt of the blade contain advanced Nemesis power field generators. Their balanced grips and nearly indestructible construction makes them perfect for parrying even the attacks of even the most powerful supernatural foe. Nemesis force weapons house a psi-matrix attuned to the unique psyche of its owner. The power of the weapon itself directly corresponds to the talent of the wielder. It's blade is actually a hybrid eezo/aura blade generated through a crystal in the handle is crystalized into a physical form when in use and dematerialized back into the crystal upon deactivation.<br>
<p><b>M-57 "Gladius" Assault Rifle</b>: The M-57 "Gladius" is a weapon reserved for elite Spectre Operatives, combining the punch of the heavy assault rifle with the rate of fire of may lighter machine guns. This rare hybrid features a high rate of fire and a large magazine capacity. Stylistically, its ergonomic stock, heavier barrel, and ammunition drum make for a well balanced weapon that fits comfortably in the user's hand. The Gladius' heavy recoil and weight make it a challenge to handle, especially at range, hence it is only used by elite marksman and tose with weapon modifications and hardsuit recoil actuators. [30 rounds per clip]<br>
<p><b>M-358 "Talon" Heavy Pistol</b>: The slow firing, semi-automatic Talon scatters projectiles like a shotgun. Firing heavy-gauge shotgun pellets, it delivers massive trauma to unarmored targets. Talon shots hit with enough force to reliably stagger all but the largest targets, including any and all animals. Its waste heat is excessive enough that it requires six separate ammunition blocks that rotate like a twentieth-century revolver to prevent premature melting of the shot. [6 rounds per clip]<br>
<p><b>M-98b "Black Widow" Sniper Rifle</b>: Accurate and deadly anti-material rifle. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Based upon a Geth weapon, several research firms spent a considerable fortune trying to redesign the Widow sniper rifle. Their goal was to retain the geth weapon's considerable firepower while reducing its recoil, so that the gun could be fired without breaking a nonsynthetic's arm. After much trial and error, one company finally produced a usable model call the the M-98 Widow. The Black Widow is further optimized to fire 3 rounds in place of the original Widow while retaining the same firepower. [3 rounds per clip]<br>
<p><b>"Sweeper" Remnant Hybrid Assault Rifle</b>: The Sweeper-a particle weapon that fires three-shot bursts-is largely a mystery to its own developers. The weapon is derived from Remnant technology, then repurposed for Andromeda Initiative needs. The Sweeper has an internal heat sink that gives it infinite spare ammunition, leaving its power supply effectively inexhaustible with overheating the only concern. It combines Remnant particle beam technology with Andromeda Initiative targeting and stabilizers. It does not require reloading, but is prone to overheating. [36 rounds before vent]<br>
<p><b>"Inferno" Remnant Hybrid Sniper Rifle</b>: The Inferno began as a failed design for a Remnant particle beam shotgun, then was reconfigured into a semi-automatic sniper weapon. It features much of the same technology based in the Sweeper Assault Rifle, but scaled and modified to be fit in a Sniper Rifle. It fires short, high-energy particle bursts and requires no reloading. This allows a sniper to continue firing until the weapon overheats. [6 rounds before vent]<br>
<p><b>"Sidewinder" Heavy Pistol</b>: The Sidewinder rapid-fire pistol is a newly developed weapon, crafted by Nexus exiles with materials and technologies unique to the Andromeda Initiative and the Heleus Cluster. Versatile and reliable, the Sidewinder is perfect for a user with few resources to fall back on. The Sidewinder is a soild mid-tier handgun whose looks, coupled with its 6-shot capacity, evoke the image of a futuristic revolver. [6 roundsper clip]<br>
<p><b>Dual "Zenith" N7 Eagle Heavy Pistols</b>: When the Alliance's Offensive Handgun Project received funding to update one of its designs, its engineers chose to redesign the already impressive Phalanx pistol. Like its predecessor, the Eagle is a compact, fully automatic pistol that delivers unprecedented accuracy and punch with a rapid firing rate. The "Zenith" is a specially customized to be enhanced by and to channel the Force. [15 Rounds per clip]<br>
<p><b>N7 Piranha Shotgun</b>: The N7 Piranha is an assault shotgun designed for the Reaper war. When the N7 program began training alien resistance forces, the lighter-bodied species wanted a low-recoil weapon with a wide pellet spread for dealing with hordes of husks. The result was the Piranha, which hit a sweet spot in close-range firepower. Its rapid-fire capability tears apart not only husks but most opponents unlucky enough to be in its way. [6 rounds per clip]<br>
<p><b>Draymak STI-27 Heavy Blaster Pistol</b>: The STI-27 is unique in the blaster world in that every shot is silent and invisible to the naked eye. It is constructed frmo an alloy of 100-grade Beskar and 40-grade Adamantium. The weapon is extremely tough and deadly and costs a small fortune (or pocket credits, depending on who you are) to own. The clip is small, but highly compact and uses nothing but tibanna gas to fill it. It stores enough gas for 100 shots, though it requires venting by 20 shots or earlier. The weapon is designed without a scope in mind as it comes with an integrated sensor and has been designed to allow it to be molecularly bonded, making it a work of art as well as a weapon. This process increases the cost dramatically.<br>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SPECIAL_ABILITIES.2C_POWERS">SPECIAL ABILITIES, POWERS</span></h2>
<p><b>True Magician</b>: Hadrian can draw upon the power of the Sixth Magic "Astral Manisfestation" to wield numerous psionic type or psychic based powers:<br>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Power of Cosmos</b>: Allows the user to draw upon the vast resources of the Cosmos and reinforce or more easily learn any skill connected to various pyschic disciplines. His vast psionic ability has also merged into his Aura and Force Sensitvity integrating them together as well as supporting his unique biotic ability (based more on psionic/telekinetic manipulation rather than controling eezo nodes reactions).</li>
<li><b>Amplification/Reinforcement</b>: He can freely use Aura/Force's more personal applications, such as the ability to strengthen the body to its maximum limit and Reinforcing even mundane weapons to the point they could match mythical weapons. This can also be used to increase both the power as well as the effects of others' semblances and Force powers.</li>
<li><b>Brilliant Mind</b>: Gifted to Genius Level, has continuously won fights in which he is outclassed using cunning strategy and an insanely adaptive thinking set. Has repeatedly outsmarted beings which can live thousands of years. To many he would be considered a consummate general and was arguably one of the most imaginative strategists and tactician amongst his peers.</li></ul>
<p><b>Special Operative</b>: With a combination of natural skill and extreme training, Hadrian has picked up a mastery in numerous combat disciplines and various support skills. Hadrian is a combat genius being a master swordsman and precise marksman, personally perfering a mix various combat styles combined with his enhanced speed and acrobatics.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Various Powers</b>: Lightsaber Master, Force enhanced strength, durability, speed, reflexes/reactions, and agility, superhuman pain tolerance, enhanced senses and perception, aura-sensing, skilled swordsman, expert marksman, skilled unarmed combatant, clairvoyance, precognition, telekinesis, telepathy, energy projection, energy shields, psychometry, accelerated healing, flow walking (can see the future and past), lightning projection (Emerald Lightning), illusions, soul manipulation, mind wiping, energy manipulation (can reflect, redirect, and absorb energy attacks thrown at him), teleportation of himself and others, Battle Meditation, Beast Language (allows the user to communicate with non-sentinent lifeforms via telepathy)
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities">Abilities</span></h3>
<p><b>Elite Warrior</b>: Hadrian is a highly skilled combatant who has been trained in a broad range of martial, weapon, and Force arts. He is both a master swordsman and precise marksman with his prefered lightsaber style involving the use of speed, acrobatics, environments, and high adaptability.</p>
<p><b>Beyond Human</b>: Hadrian can naturally function physically and mentally beyond peak human capacity, with improved strength, durability, speed, reflexes, agility, enhanced senses/perception, and rapid mental processing.</p>
<p><b>Alone or Not</b>: Hadrian is a tactical genius and a natural leader, able to operate independently or with a squadron under him.</p>
<p><b>Multi-functional</b>: Hadrian is capable of numerous mission directives, from scouting, infiltration and assassination to protection, piloting and undercover work.</p>
<p><b>Aura/Force</b>: The manifestation of one's soul, a form of Magic native to the world of Renmant, an Aura allows one to surpass their limits, and skilled users can tap upon the Power of Mana inherent within an Aura to achieve a variety of Miracles. The most common of such miracles are Semblances, which are unique powers that come deeply from within one's soul. The types and powers of Semblances vary greatly, with the weakest equaling simple magecraft and the greatest surpassing True Magic. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Aura Shield:</b> Gives the user a powerful, tactile field around their body, capable of increasing strength, speed, durability, endurance, agilty, reaction times, combat awareness, and a limited healing factor. Once this field is broken, he retains all physical enhancements except the damage reduction field.</li>
<li><b>Seeker of Truth</b>: Much like a Templar, these warriors specialize in fighting mages and demons. No enemy's magic can withstand them, and they inspire and protect their allies with their righteous power. Seekers cannot be possessed and are immune to mind control.</li>
<li><b>Force Mage</b>: The force mage specializes in powers such as telekinesis and using their minds as a weapon, bending the laws of nature to crush, toss, and debilitate their foes. They focus only on the raw application of magic, in all its vicious glory—maelstroms that draw opponents, ethereal weight that crush and slow, or great waves that throw enemies about like ragdolls. Targets not to be toyed with are simply slammed into the ground, as though pummeled by a great fist.</li>
<li><b>Arcane</b>: Arcane magic taps into the deepest wells of the Fade, protecting the caster and crushing the arcanist's foes. This is often used to strengthen and better control the mage's telekinetic powers and to channel elemental auras into their weapons.</li>
<li><b>Spirit Healer</b>: Spirit healers are mages who focus on restoration spells and use the life energy acquired from the benevolent spirits which reside in the Fade. Removing injuries, granting resilience to wounds, even rescuing comrades from the brink of death if not pure resurections—these are not support abilities, they are the core of any effective party.</li></ul>
<li><b>Creation</b>: Mages schooled in creation are invaluable allies who can heal wounds, strengthen party members, and ward against oncoming foes. They are especially skilled with reinforcement auras and Haste speed spell.</li>
<li><b>Primal</b>: Allows the command of the earth and sky. Most prefer using Lightning and Stone type spells, with a mastery in drawing power from the earth and atmosphere using Glavanism to reinforce his abilities.</li>
<li><b>Elemental</b>: The mage learns to command nature's two brutal extremes, mastering the dreadful effects of both fire and ice. Spells could go from simply lighting a flame or cooling the air to huge fire storms and freezing solid.</li>
<li><b>Spirit</b>: Spirit magic shakes foes to the core, partially bypassing resistances and effectively countering enemy mages. Users can also draw upon power from the spiritual planes to increase their spiritual and magical energy's regeneration rate and potentcy.</li><li><b>Speed/Reflex</b>: Further powers that allow him to more easily increase his body's movement to run faster, allow for rapid strikes, allow him to perceive the things around him in slow motion, and react with incredible reflexes. He often uses a variation of this to enhance his perceptions and reaction speeds to preternatural levels when in combat or piloting.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specializations">Specializations</span></h3>
<p><b>Powers/Applications</b>: Hadrian can subconsciously tap into the virtually unlimited energy resources of the Force in order to manipulate matter and energy up to a potentially unlimited scale. This can also be used to support various powers and to enhance both the wielder as well as other items and technology used by the wielder.<br>
<ul><li><b>Force Sensitive</b>: Hadrian can manipulate the Force, an energy field that exists from creation and can achieve a variety of effects. Abilities include telepathy, telekinesis, empathy, mental influence, psychometry, accelerated healing, advanced precognition, defensive barriers, and superhuman self-enhancement. He can augment his natural athleticism, allowing for speed, coordination and acrobatic maneuvers beyond natural limits. As well the vitality, health, stamina, and endurance of a Force user was naturally enhanced to varying degrees and could be boosted further. A powerful weilder could conjure lightning as well as to absorb or shield energy attacks thrown at him and to project Force Blasts of golden flames.</li>
<li><b>Aura Awareness</b>: He is able to sense danger warning him of nearby and immediate threats, sense the mental state of nearby creatures, and the natural energies that flow through a planet allowing him to sense seismic, natural, and weather patterns around him. He can enhance his senses as well, using it to track encountered scents, to detect certain chemical combinations, to hear greater distances or frequencies he might otherwise be unable to detect, and allowing him to see further and with more clarity to shifting his vision to detect infrared or radio waves.</li>
<li><b>Force Telekinesis</b>: A general term for the altering of objects through the force via pulling, or pushing. These can range from a Repulse to throw large amounts of enemies off of himself, Barriers to defend himself, or simply to push an opponent away from him. While this is a great group of abilities to learn from, it is from these sub categories that Harry finds he is naturally suitable with. Various abilities that can be labeled under this genre of the force can be anything from, Push, Pull, Rend, Burst, Whirlwind, Wave, Repulse, Inertia, Jump, Speed, Shockwave, and even Injure.</li>
<li><b>Battle Precognition</b>: Hadrian has glimmers from the Force that allow him to foretell the movements of his opponents with a degree of accuracy that is often mistaken for natural instincts and quickened reflexes. He uses this ability to predict the path of projectiles, the danger of making one action versus another in flight, or as a highly accurate form of Danger Sense that not only informs him of imminent danger but also can assist him in taking steps to avoid that unseen and unknown danger. The ability of foresight was perhaps universal to Force- sensitives and was manifested in the form of Force visions of future events, guiding premonitions or warnings, and an inflow of prescience that helped them predict their opponent's movements.</li>
<li><b>Force Enhanced Conditioning:</b> Hadrian's ability to tap energy also grants him increased speed, strength, reflexes and reactions, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance as a side effect. Masters are capable of holding this state for days to months at a subconscious level. Superhuman physical abilities grant him an added edge he has used to his advantage by developing a unique acrobatic fighting style.</li>
<li><b>Astral Wind/Force Healing</b>: Unleashes a restorative wave of Force energy, healing himself and his allies as well as recharging affected units' shields. It accelerates the body's natural healing process at a rapid pace. Master practitioners of the art can even heal themselves from fatal injuries in a short span of time (like being cooked alive, punctured lungs, etc). Although not as skilled with this ability as Master healers, Harry has shown enough competency to greatly accelerate the healing of light to moderate wounds and ease the pain of those just about to pass away.</li>
<li><b>Alter Environment/Lightning</b>: An ability which allows the user to manipulate the weather around them. Hadrian has used this ability to conjure a thick fog to cover an escape, blast away enemies with powerful whirlwinds, freeze the surfaces of small lakes and rivers, and manipulate natural lightning from storms to strike at targets of his choosing. He has a natural ability to draw from his own force potential, or alter the surrounding area's electromagnetic signatures to become lightning for him to use. He can draw upon the electromagnetic forces with ease.</li>
<li><b>Anya-Seff:</b> Harry is able to manipulate his body's electromagnetic field to fool electroencephalo-scans, make his brain activity undetectable, and simply cause alterations to his own Electromagnetic field to survive in irradiated conditions. Harry is also able to use this ability to alter his Electromagnetic field to repel other energy fields around his body allowing him to pass through them unharmed. This can be formed as a shield that is composed of a magnetic-repulsive field, that increases the amount of damage that he can take before succumbing to an injury.</li>
<li><b>Technometry</b>: The ability to reach out and read or interact electrical systems with the force. While this is limited to mostly interpreting them and allowing him to unlock electrical locks or even open electrical doors with ease, it also allows for greater understanding of technology systems through the force, as well as how they work, function, or otherwise operate. It can also reveal weaknesses within coding, armors, or otherwise items.</li>
<li><b>Preternatural Awareness</b>: The Force innately provides him with a form of precognition allowing him to sense the path of projectiles, sometimes before they are even fired. Hadrian has amazing situational awareness and perception, especially when paired with his specialization in using it to enhance his physical speed and reflexes. His danger-sense is fine tuned, and his instincts well-honed for the rigors of combat that when paired with enhanced reflexes allows him to react incredibly fast and precise. It also combines with an innate sixth sense of the world around him for an unusually precise and astute analysis of situations, environments, and people.</li>
<li><b>Tactical Cloak</b>: The Glass-Shield Cloaking system allows the user to turn invisible using light-refracting mass effect fields, hiding you from visual and technological detection - a tactical advantage in infiltration and wetwork.  It achieves this by generating a carefully tuned, spherical, electromagnetic mass effect field that can control the refraction of light in the user's immediate vicinity. In essence, this field steers light around the user and returns it to its original path with a perturbation rate of less than 3%.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h3>
<p><b>Runes of Battle</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Quicken</b>: The psyker twists time, their outline blurring as they and their fellows move like phantoms across the field. </li>
<li><b>Enhance</b>: The psyker enhances the combat skills of his allies.</li>
<li><b>Conceal/Reveal</b>: The psyker takes command of the darkness around them, using it to conceal their kin or reveal any opponents who skulk in the shadows.</li>
<li><b>Empower/Enervate</b>: The psyker helps their comrades to strike at their full potential, imbuing them with the strength of the Aeldari heroes of old whilst diminishing the powers of his foes.</li></ul>
<p><b>Runes of Fate/Divination</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Guide</b>: The psyker twists the strands of destiny to their will, picking out targets from amidst the swirling chaos of battle and guiding the shots of his allies to where they might do the most harm.</li>
<li><b>Prescience</b>: The psyker can effortlessly predict the paths of bullets and swords. By focussing his Warp-sight even more closely, he can guide his allies' aim, bringing a swift and merciless death to their foes.</li>
<li><b>Perfect Timing</b>: As soon as his consciousness pierces the veil of the Warp, a rush of images floods the diviner's mind, foretelling the actions of his enemies, down to the merest microsecond. Armed with this information, the diviner's allies can predict exactly when their foes will peer out from behind cover and expose themselves to a lethal head shot.</li>
<li><b>Scrier's Gaze</b>: The diviner can see the battlefield clearly in his mind's eye, with the vantage point of a hunting hawk and the precision of a laser. The to and fro of armies and war machines is but the scurrying of ants beneath his omniscient gaze. Thus can the diviner direct exactly when and where they are most needed, leaving no clue behind as to how this trickery was achieved.</li></ul>
<p><b>Aura Shield:</b> The manifestation of one's soul, "Aura", grants it's users a variety of abilities. He gains a powerful, damage dampening tactile field around the body, that grants super strength, speed, durability, agility, stamina, and senses, as well as higher reaction times, combat awareness, and a limited healing factor. It's nature works as a sixth sense to monitor the battlefield as well as a danger sense paired with enhanced reflexes.</p>
<p><b>Dark Energy Manipulation</b>: Hadrian can mentally use Aura to manipulate dark energy to create and manipulate mass effect fields as biotic skills. Most biotic abilities fall into three categories. The simplest are instinctive abilities, such as barriers, biotic martial arts, and direct kinetic effects like telekinesis. These rely on a direct manipulation of mass effect energies. More complicated are invoked effects, which require some level of control over the field, such as warp fields, biotic explosions, and other indirect applications. These use the body's nervous system to shape the field, almost like a pulsar field. The most complex biotics are evoked effects, which use the fields to directly manipulate energy or gravity as a force instead of upon an object. The most spectacular effects of biotics, such as singularity or blaze, fall into this category.</p>
<ul><li><b>Biotics</b>: Due to his unique nature, at a very basic, he has cooldown times a quarter that of conventional biotics, and power levels augmented by ambient heat, magnetism or existing dark energy and can use enough power to tear down skyscrapers or operate at a micro-precision level. He is able to feel the fields of mass and gravity vector, permeating the surrounding space. It operates not with separate vectors and parts of space, but with whole planes and "gravitational currents" in them. Telekinesis is as natural for him as the movement of limbs - it does not require concentration, everything happens at the level of reflexes. A biotic of such a rank is able to effectively resist the directed gravitational and biotic effects and to “crack” other people's biotic barriers, as well as repel heavy fire at numerous opponents.</li>
<li><b>Force:</b> Force is the common term for using potential kinetic energy to weigh down the hands or feet for close quarters battle. A variation on this not only enhances the impact power of their punches and kicks, but uses carefully timed pulses of gravitic force to accelerate his body and movements to extreme levels. This allows devastating hits with fluidity and evasion.</li>
<li><b>Slide:</b> This modified form of lift creates gravity-lite tunnels and channels through which a user can move or slide with extreme speed and ease. Combined with aid (biotics boosted jump or leap), it allows stupendous feats of acrobatics and evasion. Clever uses of these fields can also slow opponents even as the biotic moves too fast to counter.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="NOTABLE_ITEMS">NOTABLE ITEMS</span></h2>
<p><b>Warlock Gear HSBC-04 "Ancient Apocalypse" Combat Armor Set</b>: A uniquely built clothing-like armor based upon mixing ancient Inusannon technology with modern Light based equipment, generating electromagnetic waves and fields to repel attacks aimed at the user. They have limited energy per wave, which is why bullets and small destructive waves are blocked with few problems, but not more powerful explosions. However the user's Light/Aura energy can easily recharge these fields given a few short seconds. These can also be upgraded to include a unique "heavy" enhancement that acts as an extra layer of protection including various metal enchanted armor, laser and kinetic barrier shields and garments that provide high protection against physical, plasma, and energy attacks. It also offers a variety of new support such as: a Medigel auto-system and nano auto-repair; Micro-computers, sensors, nano technology, neural system and Virtual Intelligence assistant; and Helmet integrates a great quantity of powerful micro-computers and sensors, that help to soldiers in detections, vision, scanner, health, communication, protection, etc. that show the data in the screen.<br>
<p><b>"Trust" Hand Cannon</b>: Creates solar light elemental explosions on precision hits with high speed reloads and high levels of handling and stability. Fires extremely quickly with precision accuracy.<br>
<p><b>"Cerberus+1" Auto Rifle</b>: Four barreled auto rifle that fires shots in spread that can rapidly take down opponents. With precise aiming can focus the spread in a smaller area for more damage. It is somewhat of mix of shotgun and an auto rifle with the rifle's range and rate of fire combined with the shotguns spread and damage.<br>
<p><b>"Edge Transit" Grenade Launcher</b>: Fires high speed powerful void light powered projectiles that can stick to surfaces and explode on target proximity.<br>
<p><b>"Mantle of the Light" Nemesis Force Saber</b>: The Force Saber exemplifies an amalgamation of sorcery and science. Force sabers are crafted using arcane magicks and complex scientific formulae and incorporates a powerfield like Nemesis Force Weapons. The handle is tempered iron, flecked with shards of silver and inset with ancient runes of daemon-slaying. In contrast to these primitive materials, the haft and hilt of the blade contain advanced Nemesis power field generators. Their balanced grips and nearly indestructible construction makes them perfect for parrying even the attacks of even the most powerful supernatural foe. Nemesis force weapons house a psi-matrix attuned to the unique psyche of its owner. The power of the weapon itself directly corresponds to the talent of the wielder. It's blade is actually a hybrid energy blade generated through a crystal in the handle that is crystalized into a physical form when in use and dematerialized back into the crystal upon deactivation.<br>
<p><b>M-98b "Black Widow" Sniper Rifle</b>: Accurate and deadly anti-material rifle. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Based upon a Geth weapon, several research firms spent a considerable fortune trying to redesign the Widow sniper rifle. Their goal was to retain the geth weapon's considerable firepower while reducing its recoil, so that the gun could be fired without breaking a nonsynthetic's arm. After much trial and error, one company finally produced a usable model call the the M-98 Widow. The Black Widow is further optimized to fire 3 rounds in place of the original Widow while retaining the same firepower. [3 rounds per clip]<br>
<p><b>Draymak STI-27 Heavy Blaster Pistol</b>: The STI-27 is unique in the blaster world in that every shot is silent and invisible to the naked eye. It is constructed frmo an alloy of 100-grade Beskar and 40-grade Adamantium. The weapon is extremely tough and deadly and costs a small fortune (or pocket credits, depending on who you are) to own. The clip is small, but highly compact and uses nothing but tibanna gas to fill it. It stores enough gas for 100 shots, though it requires venting by 20 shots or earlier. The weapon is designed without a scope in mind as it comes with an integrated sensor and has been designed to allow it to be molecularly bonded, making it a work of art as well as a weapon. This process increases the cost dramatically.<br>
<p><b>"KASPR" SOCOM Pulse Rifle</b>: Developed from the baseline of the M-8 Avenger, the prototype KASPR combines the best parts of the M-76 Revenant and the N7 Valkyrie into a balanced and stable frame. The prototype was developed by colonial scientists to serve as a virtual extension of its user's body. As the prototype was initially built for a Shadow Marshal, it has been modified to feed data directly to their AI, allowing adjustments to the automatic weapon's balance, recoil, and aiming. This weapon is designed to be modular, allowing quick barrel and attachment changes to suit operational needs. Common modifications include Covert, Assault, DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle), and HBAR (Heavy Barrel) setups. [50 rounds per clip]<br>

<p><b>Energy Reserves:</b> While Hadrian has an immense reserve, he is limited by how much he can channel at one time, or how much his body/soul can store at one time or how many times it can handle being refiled.<br>

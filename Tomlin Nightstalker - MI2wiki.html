<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SPECIAL_ABILITIES.2C_POWERS">SPECIAL ABILITIES, POWERS</span></h2>
<p><b>True Magician</b>: Hadrian can draw upon the power of the Third Magic "Heaven's Feel" to wield numerous soul type or based powers:<br>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Materialization of the Soul</b>: Allows the user to exist independantly of the body and offers a sort of spiritual immortality. Even the loss of the body can be counterd by building a new body out of spiriton particles. This also grants him the ability to eventually replicate any soul based skills, powers, or even equipment.</li>
<li><b>Spiritual Awareness/Reinforcement</b>: He is able to sense danger warning him of nearby and immediate threats, sense the mental state of nearby creatures, and the natural energies that flow through a planet allowing him to sense seismic, natural, and weather patterns around him. He can enhance his physical senses as well, using it to track or recognize scents he may have encountered, to hear greater distances or frequencies he might otherwise be unable to detect, and allowing him to see further and with more clarity.</li>
<li><b>Brilliant Mind</b>: Gifted to Genius Level, has continuously won fights in which he is outclassed using cunning strategy and an insanely adaptive thinking set. Has repeatedly outsmarted beings which can live thousands of years. To many he would be considered a consummate general and was arguably one of the most imaginative strategists and tactician amongst his fellows.</li></ul>
<p><b>Captain-Commander</b>: Trained as a Shinigami and Ninja, he also picked up a mastery in numerous weapons skills and computers. Hadrian is a master swordsman usually combining with his speed and acrobatics. He is also a precise marksman, personally perfering assault rifles and pistols.<br>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities">Abilities</span></h3>
<p><b>Immense Spiritual Power</b>: The energy released by the soul, often used to augment physical skills and energy blasts. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Energy Manipulation</b>: He can project energy blasts, streams, waves and bolts of his own energy, allowing him to hit, push/pull or blow away his targets, potentially exerting enough force to destroy them, or create protective force fields. This energy manifests in any shape or form, outlining his spheres of influence, as the energy is visible in a silver/black color. Skilled users can also create pressurized areas near their bodies, allowing them to create invisible footholds in midair, essentially allowing them to walk, run, jump, climb and stop themselves without anything actually being there to allow any of those actions normally.</li>
<ul><li><b>Sharingan</b>: It grants the user an incredible clarity of perception, allowing the user to pick up on subtle details. This gives a boost or heightened sense of reaction timing, reading the movements of the incoming target(s) or opponent(s), allowing them to evade or counter accordingly with thoroughness envied by many who worked for that kind've reflex timing. It's second ability is that it grants the user an eidetic memory. The final ability granted is a type of energy sight (covers all kinds from Magic to Natural) which also grant s type of Illusion resistance.</li>
<li><b>Haki</b>: Haki is an ability to sense spiritual energy (Kenbunshoku), use life force (Busoshoku) and overpower enemies (Haoshoku). Hadrian normally used this to keep a sixth sense of the world around them to combine with his precognitive abilities and to use his fighting spirit and will as armor to defend against attacks or to make his own attacks more potent. Naturally this "invisible armor" can also be used as a weapon to strike others with and to augment the his physical attacks, projected ahead as pure brute force, or imbued into weapons to increase their effectiveness.</li>
<li><b>Deva Path</b>: Due to unknown reasons, he gained the ability to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces with objects and people, which he combines with his energy manipulation to duplicate biotic abilities.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Aura, Light of the Soul</b>: Gives the user a powerful, tactile field around their body, capable of increasing strength, speed, durability, endurance, agilty, reaction times, combat awareness, and a limited healing factor. Once this field is broken, he retains all physical enhancements except the damage reduction field.</li>
<li><b>Neuro-Electric Sensitivity</b>: Through a neuro-electric interface, Hadrian has the natural ability to perceive the emotions and sometimes thought of sentient beings within range of his spiritual pressure. This can be extended further for a touch based Psychometric ability as well as mental interfacing with technology.</li></ul>
<p><b>Primal Kido Arts (Magic)</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Primal</b>: Allows the command of the earth and sky. Most prefer using Lightning and Stone type spells, with a mastery in drawing power from the earth and atmosphere using Glavanism to reinforce his abilities.</li>
<li><b>Elemental</b>: The mage learns to command nature's two brutal extremes, mastering the dreadful effects of both fire and ice. Spells could go from simply lighting a flame or cooling the air to huge fire storms and freezing solid.</li>
<li><b>Creation</b>: Mages schooled in creation are invaluable allies who can heal wounds, strengthen party members, and ward against oncoming foes. They are especially skilled with reinforcement auras and Haste speed spell.</li>
<li><b>Arcane</b>: Arcane magic taps into the deepest wells of the Fade, protecting the caster and crushing the arcanist's foes. This is often used to strengthen and better control the mage's telekinetic powers and to channel elemental auras into their weapons.</li>
<li><b>Spirit</b>: Spirit magic shakes foes to the core, partially bypassing resistances and effectively countering enemy mages. Users can also draw upon power from the spiritual planes to increase their spiritual and magical energy's regeneration rate and potentcy.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specializations">Specializations</span></h3>
<p>These are the various mystical specializations Hadrian has access to in order of the most skill to the least:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Seeker of Truth</b>: Much like a Templar, these warriors specialize in fighting mages and demons. No enemy's magic can withstand them, and they inspire and protect their allies with their righteous power. Seekers cannot be possessed and are immune to mind control.</li>
<li><b>Force Mage</b>: The force mage specializes in powers such as telekinesis and using their minds as a weapon, bending the laws of nature to crush, toss, and debilitate their foes. They focus only on the raw application of magic, in all its vicious glory—maelstroms that draw opponents, ethereal weight that crush and slow, or great waves that throw enemies about like ragdolls. Targets not to be toyed with are simply slammed into the ground, as though pummeled by a great fist.</li>
<li><b>Spirit Healer</b>: Spirit healers are mages who focus on restoration spells and use the life energy acquired from the benevolent spirits which reside in the Fade. Removing injuries, granting resilience to wounds, even rescuing comrades from the brink of death if not pure resurections—these are not support abilities, they are the core of any effective party.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h3>
<p><b>Runes of Battle</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Quicken</b>: The psyker twists time, their outline blurring as they and their fellows move like phantoms across the field. </li>
<li><b>Enhance</b>: The psyker enhances the combat skills of his allies</li>
<li><b>Conceal/Reveal</b>: The psyker takes command of the darkness around them, using it to conceal their kin or reveal any opponents who skulk in the shadows.</li></ul>
<p><b>Runes of Fate</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Guide</b>: The psyker twists the strands of destiny to their will, picking out targets from amidst the swirling chaos of battle and guiding the shots of his allies to where they might do the most harm.</li></ul>
<p><b>Daemonology (Sanctic)</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Banishment</b>: The psyker bends his will to dissolving the bonds that tether the daemonic to the mortal plane, casting them back into the Warp.</li>
<li><b>Gate of Infinity</b>: SThe psyker punches a corridor through the roiling Immaterium, allowing him to cross great distances in the blink of an eye.</li>
<li><b>Hammerhand</b>: Focusing the raging power of their minds, psykers trained in this skill can augment the already prodigious might of themselves and their allies. Even unarmed, such warriors can crush flesh and bone—given blade or hammer there is little limit to what they can slay.</li>
<li><b>Sanctuary</b>: Chanting words of warding, the psyker creates a zone of light and psychic turbulence around him that can both protect him from physical harm as well as repel daemonic creatures and other threats of the Warp. This barrier extends out around the psyker in a 10-m-radius and impedes all those who attempt to cross. The barrier does not impede the psyker's movement in any way.</li>
<li><b>Purge Soul</b>: The psyker draws upon every ounce of willpower he possesses to purge the evil of his foes' souls, scouring every trace of corruption even if it destroys them in the process.</li>
<li><b>Cleansing Flame</b>: The psyker harnesses the very fire in his soul, creating a wall of white-hot psychic flame that blasts forth and purges his foes from the battlefield.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="NOTABLE_ITEMS">NOTABLE ITEMS</span></h2>
<p><b>ACSA-1A Assault Combat Super Armor</b>: A new unique design armor for all soldiers, no matter the class, with new alloys and materials (more resistance, flexibility and low weight) and new nano and robotic technology. The new armors have many advantages in comparison with old armors: 
<ul><li>2,7 times more Armor Resistance and heat dissipation.</li>
<li>200% more mobility, with new robotics, exoskeleton and nano system helps (improve abilities), graviton system in the boots and a little jump thruster.</li>
<li>4 times better Energy Shields with 4 level of protection: new Kinetics Barriers, tech Armor protection, Holo Armor and Skin local predictable energy shield.</li>
<li>Micro-computers, sensors, nano technology, neural system and Virtual Intelligence assistant.</li>
<li>Anti-Indoctrination System and anti-hack.</li>
<li>Ultra Low Weight, thanks to new materials.</li>
<li>Resistance to all weather, radiation, EMP, toxic environment, high and low temperatures. Continuous oxigen capability with new artificial photosynthesis recycler system and filters.</li>
<li>Medigel auto-system and nano auto-repair</li>
<li>Quantum, FTL and normal Communication systems</li>
<li>Cloaking system (but lost the shield and some function meanwhile use this option)</li>
<li>Mini energy reactor with regeneration system (produce or recover energy with movement of the soldier and corporal temperature). Provide the energy for the armor.</li></ul><br>
<p><b>PSI-013TXH "Eidolon-Oculus" Tactical Survival Helmet</b>: The helmet shares the rest of its functions with the rest of the suit and can be limited the smaller glasses/visor type headpiece, which include a comm system and infrared vision. A HUD system is also present, capable of showing a map display in the left-hand corner and a zoom function for increased sight range and target acquisition. The helmet visor also enhances sight, and includes an automated targeting system that calculates atmospheric pressure and wind shear. Passive and active scans can be carried out, displayed on a wrist unit. Such scans can designate affiliation of a target, alert a ghost to hazardous terrain (e.g. fissures), scan chemical substances and pick up living and/or moving targets. The suit's HUD provides the psyker information on his/her health status, the amount of psionic energy available, a stealth meter (an indication as to how exposed the ghost is to being seen) and a weapon meter, informing the ghost of how much ammunition is available for his/her equipped weapon.<br>
<p><b>"Kusanagi" Nemesis Force Katana</b>: Each individually-crafted Nemesis Force Weapon is a potent combination of advanced power projection circuitry and arcane psychic sorcery. The ability of the weapon to channel the psychic power unleashed by a psyker into a lethal strike makes them devastatingly powerful weapons in close combat against supernatural or Warp-tainted foes. The power unleashed by the Nemesis Force Weapon directly corresponds to the ability of the individual psyker. Force swords are crafted using arcane magicks and complex scientific formulae and incorporates a powerfield like all Nemesis Force Weapons. The blade is tempered iron, flecked with shards of silver and inset with ancient runes of daemon-slaying. In contrast to these primitive materials, the haft and hilt of the sword contain advanced Nemesis power field generators. Their balanced grips and nearly indestructible construction makes them perfect for parrying even the attacks of even the most powerful daemonic foe.<br>
<p><b>C-10X Canister Rifle</b>: The weapon fires 25mm antipersonnel rounds with 75 rounds per magazine. These rounds appear to be charged with energy instead of relying purely on conventional explosives and have the power to destroy siege tanks from the inside. This version is also equipped with a flashlight, can fire EMP rounds that punch through shields and deplete energy sources, lockdown rounds, and has retained the low frequency targeting laser that is used to guide tactical nuclear missiles and now drop pods to their intended destination. The accuracy of ghosts has improved thanks to the Mk. VI containing a magnetic grid tracker to verify coordinates. These rifles are augmented with recoil absorption for accurate follow-up shots, an automatic aim compensation module that compensates for wind speed, gravity and the Coriolis effect, and sixteen sound-suppressing baffles. This allows for the rifle to be used as both an automatic weapon and as an anti-personnel sniper rifle, capable of a one-shot kill as well as be modified to handle grenades like the C-20A.<br>
<p><b>Dual Lyndwyrm A-25A "Volcano" Autopistols</b>: An Autopistol is a rapid-firing, fully automatic ballistic firearm that has a faster rate of fire than most other pistol-grade weapons. Manufactured to an exacting standard rivaling that of the Lathes, the Volcano is renowned for reliably firing every time, its mechanisms so precise and well-calibrated that it almost never jams or misfires. A fire selector allows the user to quickly switch between semi-automatic and full automatic fire. It possesses anywhere from 40-100 rounds per magazine.<br>
<p><b>Artifex Pattern Bolter</b>: A .75 caliber weapon, the Boltgun fires a self-propelled explosive 'bolt' which explodes with devastating effect once it has penetrated its target, effectively blowing it apart from the inside. The artifex pattern bolter is amongst the most potent of its kind. It is fitted with multi-spectral augur lenses, a silacharibdis shot selector and a gene-grip bioveritor. They are hand made by a small cadre of artificers using the finest materials and alloys, with the heavy work performed by specially designed servitors. The resultant weapon is both extremely sophisticated and blessed with a well-disposed and warlike spirit that responds only to its rightful owner and will see its owner through where even other bolters may fail. It cam also be included with a gene-lock circuit in the grip ensures only the owner's hand can fire the pistol. Bolters are usually only equipped with 20 rounds magazines, though some have 40 instead.<br>
<b>Darkstaff of Aeternity</b>: A powerful, Aether-infused staff, which enables him to channel his psychic powers into devastating attacks, especially in close combat, and with this weapon he rarely misses<br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WEAKNESSES">WEAKNESSES</span></h2>
<p><b>Magical Reserves:</b> While Hadrian can theoretically use his personal Mana for a variety of spells, he is far more limited in how many times he can use it without taking a break due to his much lower reserves. For this reason, he personally prefers using his Psyker powers instead limiting his Magical uses normally for the Spirit Arts unless he has no other choice.<br>

<strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Many of his advanced abilities require energy to use, and when this energy runs out he needs nutrients in order to fully recharge it, however we see in the comic in contrast to the game, that he can spam his abilities quite frequently and that it's not a real issue<br />

<strong>Speed:</strong> <a class="wiki_link" href="speed.html">Hypersonic</a> <span class="wiki_link_ext">(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.narutoforums.com/blog.php?b=19718" rel="nofollow">Mach 6+</a></span>)<br />

<strong>Stamina:</strong> Peak human+ (never particularly shown to tire, most of Human Revolution took place over just a few days)<br />
<strong>Standard Equipment:</strong> Wields numerous weapons over the course of the game, but, other than his various augment weaponry, he mostly relies on a set of customized personal weapons: 1-2 Zenith CA-4 10mm Pistols, a FR-27 Sanction Flechette Rifle, a Mustang Arms .357 Magnum Revolver, and a Longsword II 203 ERSR Sniper Rifle.<br />
<strong>Intelligence:</strong> A skilled and experienced strategist, very knowledgeable about electronics and augmentations in general with special training in detective work and stealth. A side effect of his augmentations has granted him an increased amount of intelligence and superhuman-level multitasking and learning capabilities.<br />

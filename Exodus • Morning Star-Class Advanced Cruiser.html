<ul>
<li> Summary: Project Halo is an experimental cybernetic program designed to seamlessly fuse the power of a shipboard computer with the power of an organic brain. The pilot is hooked up to the ship with a series of nodes (after undergoing prior surgery to implant the equipment required to plug in with the ship). The Halo apparatus receives input from the shipboard computers and translates it into something the pilots brain can read. At the same time, the Halo receives information from the pilots brain and translates it into something the computers can read. The pilot, coupled with the shipboard systems, can greatly boost a ships in-combat and out-of-combat efficiency, such as reducing maneuvers to a thought as opposed to a series of complicated inputs. However, keep in mind that this is only a prototype. While functional, there are still many quirks and hiccups between the pilot and the computer. Side-effects of the aforementioned problems can include mild hallucinations when the Halo does not recognize and therefore cannot translate input from the computer. Inversely, the pilot may mis-control something within the ship or be unable to access a specific part of the ships systems.
<br>
<strong>ADDENDUM, 3572 BBY:</strong> More recent developments have eliminated most of the unrecognized commands and made the link between pilot and ship almost seamless, thanks to insights also granted by those working on the Proto-Titan program.

<strong>History</strong><br>
<br>
"Pragari" is the Sith Khutrai word for "blaze." Like the Plesrunas battleship, the Pragari-class battlecruiser is fully able to live up to its name. With the amount of firepower these fearsome twelve-hundred meter behemoths carry with them into battle, these ships are typically seen as command cruisers or as superheavy combatants. So far, not a single Pragari has been seen outside of the Firefist Galaxy. These ships were designed with the Plesrunas-class battleships and Phoenix Ascension in mind, being able to work in-tandem with their smaller cousins.<br>
<br>
The Pragari is, without a doubt, the most costly ship within Tave Drajunas' arsenal. However, the cost of the ship is not measured in credits, but rather how much material the faction needs to mine or farm in order to build those materials into a Pragari-class Star Destroyer. However, unlike the Star Destroyers of the old Galactic Empire, the Pragari was designed to truly and completely be a ship for war, and nothing else.<br>
<br>
These leviathans of obsidian-black steel are set apart from most Star Destroyers in the way that they do not have a command tower. Period. Such a jutting structure is considered a blatant and obvious weak point. But unlike the Plesrunas, there is not even a structure on the hull that even vaguely resembles a "fake" bridge; the viewing ports of the Pragari ships are safely within the hull; as are the primary and secondary CICs.<br>
<br>
The idea behind the Pragari is not to strike fear into a population or invoke dread at their coming, the idea behind the Pragari-class Star Destroyer is to be the ultimate destructive force. Its designers knew that right from day one, any engagement the Pragari would enter, it would be outgunned and outnumbered. So they designed it to be as resilient and as destructive as it can be, similarly to the Plesrunas. In this way, the Pragari can soak up weapons fire and be a big, floating target instead of the smaller, more vulnerable ships it may be protecting.</div>

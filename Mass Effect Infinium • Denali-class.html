<strong>Class Description</strong>: <br>
<br>
Developed to coincide with the new <em>Veracruz</em>-class battle cruisers, the <em>Denali </em>is the next class in the Alliance's dreadnought fleet and the newest in the last few decades since the introduction of the <em>Kilimanjaro</em>-class. Like the <em>Veracruz </em>it was planned to incorporate a significant amount of technology based on and sourced from the hulls of Reapers.<br>
<br>
The first departure from other dreadnoughts is it's primary armament. All of the guns that would normally be mass accelerator cannons, from the main gun to the broadside guns, are the latest versions of the Mark IV Mjolnir cannon, providing comparable firepower to the Reapers themselves while still taking up significantly less space than mass accelerators. The designers took advantage of this added space to add more space for munitions, cargo, and shore craft. Because of this the ship can also carry two small light frigate/corvette-type ships within its holds to use as ready escorts.<br>
<br>
In certain situations, the <em>Denali </em>could serve as a base ship for marine assaults carrying the necessary troops, vehicles, and supplies to conduct a small expedition. It's two multi-mission bays can be modified to whatever specific role it needs to fill when in certain operations. It can also serve in a more-solo hunting/attack role with it's improved handling, acceleration, the bow cannons, and ability to carry it's own escort ships. <br>
<br>
Obviously, though, prolonged or heavy engagements would require a steady supply line and escorts. And with it's substantial mass this ship still maneuvers better than an <em>Everest</em>- or <em>Kilimanjaro</em>-class dreadnought but it's still not as nimble as a cruiser.<br>
<br>
As with the <em>Veracruz</em>-class cruisers the <em>Denali </em>uses a larger version of the Regulus Mass Effect Drive Core, giving the ship longer range at FTL than the rest of the dreadnoughts in the fleet. The Quantum Entanglement Communicator is also more efficient in power draw due to studies of similar devices used by the Reapers. The power conduits mimic those used on Reapers to increase both their power transfer rates and load. Sensors also have increased sensitivity and are even capable of detecting dark energy shifts created by other ship FTL cores. The computer systems have also been optimized for improved automation of more-menial tasks, coordination of ship operations and control over defensive systems such as the GARDIAN batteries.<br>
<br>
The shield emitters have also been boosted with some design hints to increase efficiency and strength along with an additional feature. In combat the Reactive Multicore Shielding typically activates it's main cyclonic shielding feature when an incoming projectile or ordinance is expected to hit. The <em>Denali</em> can now activate the cyclonic shields along whole sides of the ship to provide maximum protection if under intense fire from a particular direction - for example, when trading broadside fires with opposing ships. The trade off is that the sustained power flow can only be maintained for a short period of time. Additionally repeated use of this means added maintenance for the shield emitters themselves after combat.<br>
<br>
The first ship of the line, <em>SSV Denali</em>, was commissioned in 2197 after efforts were made to speed up its shakedown testing and get it ready for service. The <em>Rainier </em>was launched and commissioned shortly after and additional ships of the line will be following suit and entering the service in 2198.<br>

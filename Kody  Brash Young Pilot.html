Ki Drayson was conceived fifty four years before the Clone Wars by his 
parents Jedi Knight Valin Drayson and Jedi Knight Sylvn 
Drayson. On the planet of Corellia at the family estate, this was the 
birth place of several Jedi and non Jedi family members 
throughout the years. Like all family members before him who showed 
promise in using the force, he was taught in a few ways of 
the Jedi Order until their day of coming of age when they were asked if 
they wanted to join the Jedi order or not. If they did 
wish to join the order then they were sent to the Jedi Temple on 
Coruscant. If not, they were taught at home on certain subjects 
then sent to any school across the galaxy of their choice once fourteen.
 But under an anagram of their true name so that they 
may remain safe until they could handle their own.<br><br>

Ki didn't want to become a Jedi at all even though it was important for him to follow in the footsteps of his family and those 
in his family before him to become part of the heritage of being a Corellian Jedi. His Uncle Jedi Master Quintan Drayson even 
came back to the family estate to talk with Ki about his decision on not joining the order but with no success. For Ki told him 
"I must find my own path. If I don't then I'm selling myself short." So with that being said he went to the Mrlsst Academy in 
the Tapani Sector under the name of Kody Sarin.<br><br>

Life on Mrlsst was a complete one eighty on what he was use to on 
Corellia. Instead of living in normal buildings one found on 
Corellia one lived in structures built into the green stalked plants 
that could be found as far as one could see; giving a 
feeling of being one with nature almost at all time. Within his first 
year Kody learned several new languages, about different 
cultures, and many other subjects. But that all changed when his Uncle 
Quintan came to Mrlsst to inform him that his Mother and 
Father were murdered by some unknown party. The news of hearing that his
 parents were murdered hit him like a herd of bantha. He 
asked his Uncle if anyone was investigating their deaths, but Quintan's 
answer was no.<br><br>

However, even in the darkest hour of Kody's life Quintan asked him again if he would join the Jedi Order. But Kody said nothing 
in return for a few minutes save for an icy stare that seemed to pierce right through Quintan's skull. Then "What do you think! 
Uncle! Huhhhh." Kody said while clenching his fist "And don't say control my emotions for it will lead me down the dark path if 
I don't. Thanks for telling me about my parents' deaths, but just get the frill out of here will you." He yelled as he punched 
his Uncle in the face who didn't even try to block Kody's blow. Without anger in his voice Quintan responded "As you wish Ki. I 
understand and if you wish to talk to me you know how to contact me," then he walked away.<br><br>

Several days passed, and as each went by Kody's mood just got darker and darker until he got the brash idea of finding his 
parents' murderer or murderers himself. So, using what knowledge his father taught him on the construction of lightsabre and 
giving him just enough understanding to make him a little dangerous. He constructed himself a lightsabre; actually a lightfoil. 
Sure, it wasn't as strong as a lightsabre, but it was just as deadly. With the teachings his Mother and Father it made him even 
more so. Over the next year he followed the trail of his parents finding out leads here and there until he found what he was 
looking for. It was a minor crime boss by the name of Bruth Mak using the planet Ziost as his base of operations.<br><br>

Kody Sarin headed to Ziost with darkness in his soul to kill the one who
 murdered his parents. However, all was not as it seamed 
as he broke into Mak's wretched hive of villainy, but alas, it was all 
an elaborate trap.<br><br>

"Well, well, well� what do we have here? Kody Sarin, or should I wager a
 member of the Drayson clan" a figure in the shadows 
spoke, then laughed malignantly as several figures came out of the 
shadows, some brandishing blasters while others ignited their 
crimson lightsabres.<br><br>

"Bruth, come out!!" Kody bellowed as he ignited his lightfoil.<br><br>

"Ahhhh you crafted your own sabre then. Let's see what you can do� get him my minions" the figure ordered causing his followers 
with sabres to rush at Kody while the others took aim.<br><br>

Over the next few minutes a bloody battle ensued with Kody outnumbered ten to one. But the lessons his parents taught him kept 
him on course as he killed one after another of Bruth's minions making him fall deeper into the sweet nectar of darkness. As he 
fought he could feel his body surge with dark energy that consumed him from every direction until at last, he and Bruth Mak 
remained, the sole figure he still hadn't seen as yet.<br><br>

"You've done well Kody. I sense you have danced further into the sweet allure of darkness as well of ridding me of the rest of 
the worthless souls that survived the murder of your parents." Bruth finished with an evil laugh while a crimson blade ignited 
showing instead a human female with snow white hair.<br><br>

"You're not Bruth!! Where is he?" Kody yelled as he strode forward towards his intended target. As he did she pulled something 
from around her throat.<br><br>

"Is that better child?" She howled in a now all too clear feminine tone.
 "You'll make an excellent Sith apprentice if you survive 
this." She cast off her cloak revealing her well toned, supple form clad
 in a crimson bodysuit.<br><br>

"Never!!" Kody yelled as he rushed forward striking at the women with his lightfoil. But alas, she blocked his blows with ease. 
Over the next few minutes she played with him like a hunter and her prey, until, with one final blow, she sheared his lightfoil 
in two slamming Kody to the ground, lightsabre mere millimeters from his throat.<br><br>

"You can either serve me or die!! Which is it?" She asked as her eyes narrowed and an evil grin crept across her face.<br><br>

"I take death." Kody stated without a second thought.<br><br>

"So be it!" she said, frustration in her voice. That was the last thing Kody remembered along with sudden searing pain and inky 
darkness.<br><br>

*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>

<font color="#66CCFF">Elsewhere a lone figure sat in a meditative state 
searching for his lost nephew through the ebbs of the force. But what he
 found 
was the boy he once thought he knew being consumed and using the bitter 
sweet darkness of the force. He tried to call out to the 
boy through the force but the darkness shielded him from his efforts. 
Every moment the boy killed a being it seemed to move in 
slow motion ever causing more pain to him as he watched helplessly till 
his nephew suddenly disappeared from the force causing 
the figure to jolt out of his state. Even though a Jedi must control his
 emotions a tear started to shed as he spoke to himself 
"I failed you Ki.... I will make it right.... I will make it right."</font><br><br>

*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>

Years later, but what seemed like mere moments to Kody, an icy cold feeling raced across his body followed by what felt like a 
warm summer day on Corellia.<br><br>

"That's it� take a breath� slowly now. You've just been released from 
your carbonite prison" a being, female by the sound of it, 
said to Kody as his deep breath tore at his lungs.<br><br>

"What? Where am I?" Kody asked as he slowly opened his eyes, which gave 
him no relief - complete darkness. "Why can't I see? Why 
does it hurt to breath?"<br><br>

"You were found frozen in carbonite on a freighter that crashed into the Roche Asteroid Field due to a faulty hyperdrive. The 
miners that found you brought you here so that we could give you medical attention here on New Holstice" the being, clearly 
female, recanted. "First off, what's your name?"<br><br>

"Kody Sarin" he stated. Over the next several days he had his eyesight restored through cybernetic replacement as his real eyes 
never recovered from the carbonite freeze - it was just too long.<br><br>

For fifty four years he had been out of touch with the rest of the galaxy and much had changed. The Jedi Order was no more, the 
Republic was now the Galactic Empire and he had a strange feeling that there was someone out there he needed to find.<br><br>

He knew what had to be done: find out about his past, his future and 
that strange someone. But before he left New Holstice for 
parts unknown he added three new names of the fallen Jedi on the wings 
of memory moths: Valin Drayson, Sylvn Drayson and that of 
his Uncle, Quintan Drayson into the memorial.<br><br>

A year of searching brought him to an area of space that, he hoped, promised to shed some light on the mysterious 'someone' he 
felt all those years before back on Holstice.<br><br>

As he traveled to the new area he managed to run into a large group of organized slavers. He fought well to escape, but was 
captured anyway. He remained in the hold of the slavers' ship until they reached another planet. Once there he was sold with 
all the others aboard to a large black ship he had never seen before. The ship's captain and first mate conducted that exchange 
and off they went again.<br><br>

During the long hyperspace journey the captain and first mate released 
everyone and told them that they were here to recruit all 
beings for an important benefactor. Kody, along with the rest of the 
slaves were given freedom on a safe planet or the option to 
join the group. As an incentive, the slave collars were removed.<br><br>

During the encounter the First Mate kept looking at Kody as if she knew him somehow. This was confirmed when she started giving 
out Imperial credits to those that did not join - there were not many - and then came to Kody. "Somehow, I know you. The name 
you gave is not the one I know you by and you look a bit different. Must be the hair."<br><br>

~ This has to be my first real lead on the stranger I felt those many years ago. I'll let her do the talking and see where it 
leads. ~ Kody sat up and looked at the female, smiled slightly, and said, "Really now? Where and when was this?"

<font color="#77FF46">Class Special Abilities:</font><br>
PrC Level / Special Ability<br>
1 / Leadership, Skill Bonus<br>
2 / Increase Lightsaber Damage +1D, Skill Bonus<br>
3 / Inspire Hope, Skill Bonus<br><br>

1. Leadership: When using his Command skill to combine the actions of his subordinates (for more information, see the Star Wars 
Role playing Game, 2nd Edition - Revised and Expanded, pages 82-83), the Jedi Counselor's combined action bonus is doubled to 
+2D per every three characters combining, instead of +1D.<br>
2. Increase Lightsaber Damage: A Jedi Counselor's ability to deal damage
 with a lightsaber improves as he gains levels. At 2nd level, 
the Jedi Counselor's lightsaber damage increases by +1D6. This added 
damage is cumulative with increased lightsaber damage from 
other Jedi classes.<br>
1-3. Skill Bonus: The Jedi Counselor gains a +1D skill bonus to any one of the following skills: Alien Species, Bureaucracy, 
Command, Con, Cultures, Intimidation, Languages, Law Enforcement, (A) Linguistics, Planetary Systems, Persuasion, Politics, 
Scholar, Value, First Aid, (A) Medicine, Technology and Willpower. This skill bonus is permanent.<br>
3. Inspire Hope: At 3rd level, a Jedi Counselor's reputation reaches 
such a point that anyone following him or his advice gains a bonus 
of +2D. Further those wishing to take direct action against him are 
subject to a skill penalty. This penalty is equal to the same as the 
bonus. This bonus or penalty affects all skill and attribute rolls 
(including attack rolls) made against the Jedi Counselor by other 
characters.<br><br>

<h3><font color="blue">Jedi Watchman</font></h3>

<font color="#77FF46">Class Special Abilities:</font><br>
PrC Level / Special Ability<br>
1 / Danger Sense, Skill Bonus<br>
2 / Increase Lightsaber Damage +1D, Skill Bonus<br>
3 / Force Camouflage, Skill Bonus<br><br>

1. Danger Sense: The Jedi watchman gains an insight bonus on checks to 
avoid being surprised; this is in addition to his Sense skills 
and normal perception checks. This bonus is equal to the Jedi watchman's
 class level.<br>
1-3. Skill Bonus: The Jedi Watchman gains a +1D skill bonus to any one of the following skills: Lightsaber, Climbing/Jumping, 
Computer Programming/Repair, Dodge, First Aid, Hide, Intimidation, Planetary Systems, Search, Sneak, (A) Speed Drawing, 
Scholar, Tactics, Technology and Willpower. This skill bonus is permanent.<br>
2. Increase Lightsaber Damage: A Jedi Watchman's ability to deal damage 
with a lightsaber improves as he gains levels. At 2nd level, 
the Jedi Watchman's lightsaber damage increases by +1D. At 4th level it 
increases to +2D. This added damage is cumulative with 
increased lightsaber damage from other Jedi classes.<br>
3. Force Camouflage: At 3rd level, the Jedi watchman learns a special technique to hide himself using the Force. He becomes a 
pale shadow and easily blends into his surroundings. While Force camouflage is activated, the Jedi watchman gains a +10 Force 
bonus on Hide checks. If a character succeeds in his Spot check against the Jedi watchman's Hide check, the spotter detects the 
Jedi watchman and can target him normally. However, any attack directed at the camouflaged Jedi watchman has a 20% chance to 
miss due to concealment.
A Jedi watchman can't maintain Force camouflage while using other Force skills or engaging in distracting activity.<br><br>

<h3><font color="blue">Professional Gambler </font></h3>

<font color="#77FF46">Class Special Abilities:</font><br>
PrC Level / Special Ability<br>
1 / Exceptional Resources<br>
2 / Inspire Doubt -1D<br>
3 / Skill Bonus<br><br>

1. Exceptional Resources: A Professional Gambler has access to a 
multitude of resources (from all of his winnings). Once per day, 
the Professional Gambler can make a Knowledge check to use these 
resources. The value of the resources gained equal the 
Professional Gambler's level x the total of his Knowledge rolls x 1,000.
 Thus, a 4th level Professional Gambler who rolls an 11 on 
his Knowledge check would gain 44,000 credits' worth of resources (4 x 
11 x 1,000 = 44,000). These resources can take any form 
the Professional Gambler chooses (with the GM's permission) and are his 
to do with as he wishes. The resources gained arrive \
within 1D hours.<br>
2. Inspire Doubt: Starting at 2nd level, a Professional Gambler's 
reputation reaches such a point that anyone wishing to gamble 
directly against him or even call his bluff, is subject to a skill 
penalty. This penalty is equal to -1D at 2nd level, -2D at 4th level and
 
-3D at 8th level. This penalty affects all skill and attribute rolls 
(and can include attack rolls) made against the Professional Gambler 
by other characters.<br>
3. Skill Bonus: At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, the Professional 
Gambler gains a +1D skill bonus to any one of the following skills: 
Pick Pocket, Running, Bargain, Con, Forgery, Gambling, Persuasion, 
Intimidation, Cultures, Alien Species, Communications, 
Computer Operations, Computer Programming/Repair, Droid Programming, 
Encryption, Languages, Search, Security, Sensors, 
Streetwise, Value, Technology, (A) Magician, and Willpower. This skill 
bonus is permanent.<br><br>

Model: Naboo Royal Guard Ascension Pistol<br>
Scale: Character<br>
Skill: Blaster: Heavy Blaster Pistol<br>
Cost: Unavailable, not made or sold anymore<br>
Body:  2D<br>
Body Material: <font color="red">[GM: coming soon]</font><br>
Availability: X<br>
Ammo: 25<br>
Range: 2-6/20/40<br>
Damage: 7D+2<br>
Notes: Pure Rylith Power Cell (+3D+2 damage). The S-5 heavy blaster 
pistol was a versatile weapon with a heavy wooden gripstock and twin 
scopes for sighting 
and rangefinding. Unlike most handheld blaster weapons, the S-5 fired 
green blaster bolts, similar to the Model Q2 hold-out blaster pistol. 
The S-5 also 
featured a dart launcher underneath the main barrel, able to fire either
 an anesthetic microdart, a sting charge, or a grappling hook tip. The 
latter was used 
in conjunction with a liquid-cable shooter attachment; a quick 
customization that turned the S-5 pistol into a durable ascension gun 
(as an ascension gun, the 
S-5's liquid-cable could hold up to 500 kilograms). The cable reservoir 
held enough liquid to form twenty meters of cable, and the spike 
launcher itself cost 
around 50 Republic Credits around the time of the Invasion of Naboo.<br><br>

Custom made solid holographic armor technologies coupled with fed and ancient tech; smart device system incorporated.<br>
Model: Isil-zha Holographic Armor System<br>
Type: Personal Combat Armor system<br>
Scale: Character<br>
Body: 2D<br>
Body Material: <font color="red">[GM: coming soon]</font><br>
Game effects: see below<br>
Suit: see below<br>
Description: This highly advanced holographic armor system is comprised of a body glove (treat as: Kamperdine 
Clothing Specialists CSC-5000 Body Glove, and is comprised of an Armorweave underlay that reduces 20% of all 
energy damage), gauntlets and a utility belt.<br><br>

The utility belt contains a Mk IV Super Stable Artificial Quantum Singularity (SSAQS) power containment unit 
that efficiently provides unlimited power to the suit. The utility Belt also holds many standard tools for 
combat or mission variable.<br><br>

The gauntlets provide user interface tools for: suit controls; communications; similar function features of a 
TerexComm Gauntlet-Computer Combo Model (with all available model features); an Isil-zha AI autopilot

24D); and also combines the best elements of a COM link, holonet capable computer, and digital holocam.<br><br>

Autopilot: This armor has a sentient artificial intelligence computer controlling it. Most users give nick-names 
to the AI for simplicity (such as HAL, DAVE, MOTHER, GUARDIAN, etc.�). This computer should be considered to be 
a powerful neural intelligence. The AI can be given voice commands to perform tasks that the armor system is 
capable of doing.  The user must use the Command skill to decide how many actions the AI can perform, much like 
commanding troops or NPCs.

<h3>Talents:</h3>

Varies (GM's discretion)<br><br>

<h3>Innate Abilities:</h3>

<b>Ambidextrous:</b> You are equally proficient in performing tasks with your left or right hand. The character no longer suffers 
a penalty to skill rolls when using their offhand. This does NOT mean using both hands simultaneously; that falls under 
Ambidexterity.<br>
<b>Appraisal:</b> The character can evaluate within a 20% margin the cost of an item after inspecting it<br>
<b>Eidetic Memory:</b> On an Easy Knowledge roll the character is able to recall images, sounds or objects with a very high 
degree of accuracy. Notes: This Innate Ability does not give character a perfect recall of all events. The range is 60% up 
to 90% depending on the memory and the senses involved.<br>
<b>Internal Clock:</b> On an Easy Perception roll the character can determine the time with a 5-10 minute margin of error. Notes: 
The character needs to have some form of reference point once in a new location with a different time zone and knowledge 
of the local length of day.<br>
<b>Internal Compass:</b> On an Easy Perception roll the character can determine the direction of north with a 5-10% margin of error.<br>
<b>Lightning Reflexes:</b> The character adds +2 to Perception for all initiative rolls.<br>
<b>Lip-Read:</b> On a Moderate Perception roll the character can lip-read what another being is saying. Notes: The being must 
be of the same species as the character as well as be able to see the being's lips move and speak the same language that is 
being used. However, additional species and languages may be added, up to a maximum of 3 each (start of campaign only), 
for an extra 4 CPs per species and 5 CPs per language. Also, the language must already be known and the skill of Alien 
Species must be at least 5D. There are certain languages that cannot be understood in this manner and will not be allowed.<br>
<b>Quick Draw:</b> The character may draw and use a single handheld weapon as one action. Drawing the weapon does not count 
towards the total number of actions for the round.<br>
<b>Quick Learner:</b> When learning new skills, the character advances two pips above the attribute rather than the usual one pip.
Notes: The cost in character points is the same as advancing one pip and time is reduced by at least one day.<br>
<b>Regenerate:</b> If the character is recovering from injuries through natural healing all resting times are quartered due to nanite repair 
system, e.g. a wounded character can make a roll to heal after 14 hours of rest.<br>
<b>Stubborn:</b> If someone (including an ally) attempts to Bargain, Con
 or Persuade the character, add a +5 modifier to the difficulty. 
In addition, the character adds +1D to all Willpower rolls. Notes: The 
bonus to Willpower rolls does not increase the skill itself 
and, therefore, when advancing the skill do not factor in the bonus when
 determining character points to be spent.<br>
<b>Stun Resistance:</b> It is much more difficult to stun this character. Add +1D to Strength rolls to resist all Stun damage.<br>
<b>Ventriloquist:</b> On a difficult Con roll the character can throw their voice. Notes: Normal Con modifiers apply.<br>
<b>Veteran Under Fire:</b> Suppression fire shots have a difficulty value of Very Difficult rather than Difficult against someone with this 
ability<br><br>

<h3>Equipment:</h3>
All internal, see below.<br><br>

<b>Shell/Hull:</b> Made from Tritainium and reinforced with a Hull Integrity Field (both Fed Tech). This 
has already been added into his strength rating.<br>
